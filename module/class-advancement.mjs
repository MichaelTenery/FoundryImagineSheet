// @START (CODE)
// @MARKER CLASS ADVANCEMENT
//==================================================================================================================
// Granting a character the class skills their title has earned. The rules live in class-rules.mjs,
// which knows nothing of Foundry; this is the half that talks to the world -- the skill compendium,
// the actor's items, and the hooks that notice a title changing.
//
// WHEN IT RUNS. His sheet acquires a title's class skills the moment the character reaches that
// title (handleLevelTitle, sheet-worker.js:66058 -- see the note in class-rules.mjs on why the goal
// boundary and the title boundary are the same line). So this runs on the three occasions a
// character's entitlement can change:
//     the character's title changes           updateActor
//     one class's own title changes           updateItem, a dual-classed character's per-class title
//     a class is added or its list changes    createItem / updateItem
//
// WHAT IT GRANTS. Every entitled skill the character does not already hold, with the bonuses his
// setClassSkillAbility gives: the skill's starting dice rolled, +30 if it is a CORE skill of the
// class, every class modifier naming a type the skill has, and his getExtraClassRacialMods -- the
// trait switch and what the character's social skills give it (module/social-skill-rules.mjs). That
// is getClassSkillBonuses in chargen-rules.mjs, the same function character generation uses for the
// first title's skills, so a skill granted at title 7 is built exactly like one the character
// started with. His sheet goes further and rolls every title's class skills AT CREATION (63288
// onward), with the same terms; granting them when the title arrives is the port's, and reads the
// social skills the character holds by then.
//
// The other way round -- a class skill lifting a social skill already held, Disguise giving Acting
// +15 -- is NOT done here, and no held skill is touched for it: character creation counted it
// already, from every title's class skills, since his sheet holds them all from creation and his
// getNewSocialSkillModifier reads every title's rows (125658; chargen-rules.mjs assembleCharacter).
// A class added to the character later -- a dual class, which his sheet has no provision for
// (DECISIONS 2026-09-16) -- therefore lifts no social skill the character holds.
//
// WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It never removes a skill, never touches one the character already holds, and
// never grants past a class's skill list. Slots it does not police either: the slot panel already
// reports an overrun, and his own sheet marks the excess "REMOVED" rather than refusing the title.
