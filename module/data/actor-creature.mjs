// @START (CODE)
// @MARKER CREATURE ACTOR DATA MODEL
//==================================================================================================================
// Schema for a creature in the Imagine Role Playing System.
//
// A creature is NOT a character with fewer fields. The two share their attributes, their saves,
// their per-area wounds and the attack chart, but almost everything else works the other way
// round: where a character DERIVES Endurance, resistances and its attack skill from attributes,
// race and class, a creature has them written into its stat block and simply carries them.
// Ported from his creature functions (sheet-worker.js:174658 onward) -- see docs/DECISIONS.md,
// "Creature/NPC audit findings" and the CORRECTION entry that follows it.
//
// What is entered rather than worked out:
//     Endurance, Hide, Shock       -- calcAllCreatureCaracs reads them straight off the stat block
//     all five resistances         -- entered percentages plus modifiers, with no attribute table
//     the attack chart             -- chosen outright, not read off a class progression
//     the body chart               -- stored and editable, because "Custom" is a real body type
//     every skill's chance         -- a flat percentage per skill, as the Bestiary prints it
//
// What IS worked out, in prepareDerivedData:
//     attribute saves and their table modifiers, as for a character
//     Perception, Affinity and Fortune, on a creature-only formula
//     the body's areas, their Endurance and the armour over them
//     encumbrance, and the standing combat numbers
