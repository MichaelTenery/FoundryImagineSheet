//==================================================================================================================
// Schema for a player character in the Imagine Role Playing System.
//
// Field names follow the Roll20 sheet's attributes where they map cleanly, so this can be
// diffed against the original sheet-worker. Anything DERIVED is listed in the comments but
// is NOT stored here -- it is computed in prepareDerivedData() from the attribute tables.
//
// Derivation order matters and is documented in docs/DATA-MODEL.md section 9. The short
// version: attributes -> saves and modifiers -> Endurance -> Shock -> body area maxima.
// Changing Endurance recomputes every body area, exactly as changeCharacteristics() does
// in the original sheet.
