// @START (CODE)
// @MARKER RACE ITEM DATA MODEL
//==================================================================================================================
// Schema for a race.
//
// Fields map onto the 62 columns of raceStatsAndMoveDetails in the original sheet-worker.
// That dictionary carries no column-header comment, so the layout was recovered by reading
// how the code consumes the row (tempRaceStatMoves, sheet-worker.js:33697-33758) rather than
// transcribed -- see tools/extract/column_maps.py.
//
// A race supplies three kinds of thing:
//   1. modifiers to attributes, characteristics and resistances
//   2. a per-race cap on each attribute, which is separate from and stricter than the
//      being-type cap that title confers
//   3. movement rates, at the three scales the system tracks
//
// These are read directly by the character rather than being turned into Active Effects.
// Effects are for things that come and go -- spells, conditions, injuries. A race is
// permanent character definition, the original sheet stores it as plain fields
// (race_per_mod, race_aff_mod and so on), and the character schema already has raceMod slots
// waiting for it.

			// and none in the ordinary one, and the two Fairies trade that flight for extra racial
			// skills -- a wingless Dark Fairy gains Climb and Wood Lore +10%, a wingless Fairy
