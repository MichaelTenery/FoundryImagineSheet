// @START (CODE)
// @MARKER CLASS ITEM DATA MODEL
//==================================================================================================================
// Schema for a class.
//
// Fields map onto classRequirementsAndDetails in the original sheet-worker, whose 22 columns
// carry no header comment and were recovered from how the code consumes them (classDetails,
// sheet-worker.js:51002-51023). Two sibling dictionaries hold the rest of a class's data and
// are folded in here, since they are keyed by the same class name:
//     classtitledict -- the title names earned while advancing
//     goalupdict     -- the two attributes this class may raise on a goal advance
//
// NOTE: classRequirementsAndDetails["Monk"] is malformed in the source, carrying 21 columns
// rather than 22. See docs/UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md item 1. It is reported rather than patched.

			// startingBonus and category.
