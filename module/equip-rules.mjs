// @START (CODE)
// @MARKER BEST ARMOUR
//==================================================================================================================
// Which armour a character should wear, worked out from what they own.
//
// This is a helper for the Equip Best Armour button on the Equipment tab; his sheet has no such
// button, so nothing here is ported but his refusal of barding a body was not made for
// (canBodyWearArmor, @MARKER BARDING). It follows the layering rules quoted at the top of
// module/data/item-armor.mjs (Player's Guide, Layering Armor), and it decides nothing the rules do not:
//   - at most three layers of armour on any one body location
//   - the first layer worn must be flexible (a piece with its own padding counts)
//   - each layer may only sit over something at least as flexible as itself
//   - rigid may never stack on rigid (the three "Rigid/Rigid" suits are the book's stated exception)
//   - clothing of 3 armour value or less takes no layer at all
//
// Pure rules, no Foundry: it is handed plain item data and hands back plain answers, so the test page
// can run it as it stands. Shields are left alone -- which shield to carry depends on which hand is
// free, and that is the player's call.
//==================================================================================================================
