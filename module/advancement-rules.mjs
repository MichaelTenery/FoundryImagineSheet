// @START (CODE)
// @MARKER ADVANCEMENT RULES
//==================================================================================================================
// Experience, goals and titles, with no Foundry dependency, so they can be tested outside it.
// The tables themselves are generated into advancement-tables.mjs by
// tools/extract/extract_advancement_tables.py; nothing here transcribes a number of his.
//
// HOW HIS LADDER WORKS. Experience buys GOALS, and three goals make a TITLE (his getTitleByGoal:
// title = goal/3 + 1). A goal advance is the small step -- a chance at an attribute, and a handful
// of skill points. A title advance is the large one -- new class skills, Endurance, attack charts.
// Below title 1 sit three negative goals, his Zero Title: Petitioner, Student, Apprentice.
//
// THE ORDER HIS SHEET IMPOSES, which this follows:
//     1. Experience is added, and REFUSED outright if a level-up is already pending
//        (roll_add_exp, sheet-worker.js:8239). Nothing may be banked on top of unfinished business.
//     2. It is capped by the character's CURRENT title (getExpCapByExistingTitle), so nobody banks
//        more than about a title and a half ahead without levelling.
//     3. Goals are taken one at a time. Each rolls for an attribute and spends skill points.
//     4. Where a goal crosses a title boundary, the TITLE is committed first: his handleGoalCommit
//        refuses a goal commit while a title is pending ("Commit title before committing goal").
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE. Valuing a creature and splitting its experience among a party -- his
// calcCreatureExp and handleSplitExp. The user's call, 2026-09-19: players enter the experience
// they were awarded, so there is nothing to compute.
