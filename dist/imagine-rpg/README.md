# Imagine Role Playing System — Foundry VTT system

Version 0.20.0. A conversion of the Imagine Role Playing System from its Roll20 character sheet,
built with permission from the rights holder. Foundry VTT **V14** or later.

## Installing

This folder IS the system. Put it in your Foundry data folder, under `Data/systems/`, so that the
path reads:

    Data/systems/imagine-rpg/system.json

Then restart Foundry. The system appears in the Game Systems list and can be chosen when creating a
world. (If you have the zip, unpack it so its contents land directly in a folder of that name —
the archive has no top-level folder of its own.)

## Updating

**Version 0.20.0 and later update themselves.** In Foundry's **Game Systems** tab, press
**Check for Updates**; if a newer version has been published, an **Update** button appears and
Foundry fetches and installs it. Nothing needs to be copied by hand.

This works because the manifest names where to look:

    manifest   the current system.json in the project repository
    download   the archive beside it

Foundry compares the version in your installed `system.json` against the version in the manifest,
and offers the update when they differ. It compares the version number and **nothing else** — not
dates, not file contents — so a build published without raising the version is invisible to every
existing install.

One catch, once: an install from BEFORE 0.20.0 has no `download` in its manifest and cannot
update itself. Replace that folder by hand one last time, and every update after it is a button.

After updating, rebuild the compendium content so new and corrected entries come through — the
packs are built in your world, not shipped:

    game.imagine.importContent()

## First launch

The system ships its content as JSON and builds the compendium packs when you first use it, rather
than shipping pre-built packs. On the first launch of a new world it offers to do that; accept, and
it creates nine compendia holding 4,384 entries — skills, weapons, armour, equipment, races,
classes, and the ability, disability and immunity lists.

If you decline, or want to rebuild them later after updating the system, run this in the console as
the Game Master:

    game.imagine.importContent()

It matches documents by name and updates them in place, so anything already dragged onto a character
keeps pointing at the same document.

## Before you trust it

**This system has never been run in Foundry.** `FIRST-RUN.md`, beside this file, lists what was
checked against the V14 API ahead of time, what could not be, and a ten-step smoke test in the order
things are likely to break. Step 5 is the one that matters most.

## What is not here

Everything that built this: the extraction tooling, the intermediate data, the test suites, the
original Roll20 export and the project documentation. Those live in the project repository; this
folder is only what a game needs.
