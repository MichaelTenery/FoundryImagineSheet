// The skill arithmetic, as plain functions.
//
// Nothing in this file touches Foundry, in the same shape as combat/combat-rules.mjs: every
// function takes values and returns values, dice results included, which the caller rolls and
// passes in. Line numbers against docs/reference/sheet-worker.js are given with each rule.
//
// Two things live here that the chance formula in the character model does not cover: what
// happens when the same skill is held more than once, and the slot economy the Player's Guide
// calls "slot tricks" -- trading skill slots between categories, or giving one up for a bonus.
//==================================================================================================================


// @MARKER DUPLICATE SKILLS

	// The four outcomes of a percentile skill roll, best first. His sheet prints the same four
	// words; the +/-20% margin that separates a critical from an ordinary result is the Player's
	// Guide's (p.94), not his, since his skill roll template only reports the number.
	export const SKILL_OUTCOMES = ["Critical success", "Succeeded", "Failed", "Critical failure"];

	// This is the function which reads one percentile roll against one chance.
	//
	// Rolled at or under the chance succeeds. Beating it by more than 20 is a critical success;
	// missing it by more than 20 is a critical failure. The margin is reported because the caller
	// needs it to choose between two rolls of the same kind, and because the card prints it.
	export function resolveSkillOutcome(tmpchance, tmproll) {
		var tmpnumchance = parseInt(tmpchance) || 0;
		var tmpnumroll = parseInt(tmproll) || 0;
		var tmpmargin = tmpnumchance - tmpnumroll;

		var tmpoutcome = "";
		if (tmpnumroll <= tmpnumchance) {
			tmpoutcome = (tmpmargin > 20) ? "Critical success" : "Succeeded";
		} else {
			tmpoutcome = (tmpmargin < -20) ? "Critical failure" : "Failed";
		}

		return { chance: tmpnumchance, roll: tmpnumroll, margin: tmpmargin, outcome: tmpoutcome };
	}

	// This is the function which picks the best of several rolls of the same skill.
	//
	// Player's Guide, "Duplicate Class and Racial Skills": a character may hold the same skill both
	// racially and as a class skill, and then "a skill roll can be made for each multiple of the
	// same skill, and the best roll can be chosen". His own worked example is a Civilized Human
	// Rogue with Move Unseen both ways -- one roll failed and one made is a success, and a critical
	// alongside an ordinary success may be taken as the critical.
	//
	// THE TWO ROLLS ARE NOT AGAINST THE SAME NUMBER. Each instance carries its own chance (the
	// racial one may have a racial bonus, the class one its own starting bonus and points), so each
	// is resolved against its own and only then compared -- which is why this takes resolved
	// results rather than one chance and a list of dice.
	//
	// Ranking is by outcome first, in SKILL_OUTCOMES order. Where two rolls share an outcome the
	// larger margin is named the chosen one; that tie-break is presentation only, since two
	// ordinary successes do the same thing, and the book leaves the choice to the player anyway.
	// Every roll is returned, not just the winner, so the card can show what was given up.

// @MARKER UNTRAINED SKILLS

	// This is the function which works out which skills a character could still try untrained.
	//
	// Player's Guide, "Who Can Use a Skill": a skill already held is rolled as itself, not as a
	// common skill ("any skill for which the character has rolled a starting bonus can no longer
	// be attempted as a common skill"), and a restricted skill cannot be tried at all. Both limits
	// were already applied inline where the untrained picker builds its dropdown
	// (actor-character-sheet.mjs #onRollUntrainedSkill); this pulls the same two filters out as a
	// plain function so a second caller -- a list on the Skills tab itself, rather than only the
	// dialog -- does not have to duplicate them.
	//
	// docs/sonnet/2026-09-16-skills-module.md item 1 gave `isRestricted` real data from the books
	// (366 of 674 skills; the rest report as not-found rather than guessed), so this filter now
	// does something: before that pass every skill read as unrestricted and this list would have
	// been all 674. It still is not SHORT -- of the 676 skills in the pack, 305 now carry
	// `isRestricted: true`, so an untrained character is typically offered a few hundred, not a
	// handful -- which is why item 2 of that note is still a judgement call about presentation
	// (a full inline list, a count, a search box) rather than a mechanical one this function
	// settles on its own.
	//
	//   tmpheldnames  = names of skills already on the character (any category)
	//   tmpskillindex = the skill compendium's index rows, each { name, system: { isRestricted } }
	//                   (the same shape tmppack.getIndex({ fields: [...] }) returns)
