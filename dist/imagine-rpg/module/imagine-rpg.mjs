// Converted from the Roll20 sheet by W. Michael Tenery III, with permission. Where this code
// and the printed rulebooks disagree, the Roll20 sheet is the source of truth -- see

//
// Status: character and creature data models with derived values, sheets for both, a runtime
// content importer, the content availability switches, and combat phase 1 (attack charts, attack
// and damage rolls, armour, body areas and wounds, the 10 second round). Not yet built: combat
// phase 2 and the magic subsystems, which is also what a creature's Powers wait on. See
// docs/PROGRESS.md.

	// Game Master's and is the same for everyone at that table. It is deliberately the ONLY
	// handedness switch: with it off the dropdown is not merely ignored but gone, on the character
