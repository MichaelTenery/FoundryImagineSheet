// @START (CODE)
// @MARKER ARMOUR ITEM DATA MODEL
//==================================================================================================================
// Schema for armour, clothing and shields.
//
// Fields map onto the 22 columns of armorvalueslist in the original sheet-worker: material,
// flexibility class, an armour value for each of nineteen body locations, and weight.
//
// All three kinds share one item type because the layering engine has to walk them together.
// Flexibility is what separates them mechanically, and the source data treats Clothing as a
// flexibility class of its own alongside Flexible, Semi-Flexible and Rigid.
//
// The layering rules (Player's Guide, Layering Armor):
//   - up to three layers of armour; the first worn must be flexible
//   - each layer may only sit over material at least as flexible as itself
//   - rigid may never stack on rigid
//   - shields are a fourth layer, and some other objects also qualify
//   - clothing of 3 armour value or less does not consume a layer at all, and grants one
//     free layer above or below armour
//==================================================================================================================

			// a helm with a rigid shell over a flexible lining, for instance. The source
			// records these as "Rigid/Flexible", "Rigid/Semi-Flexible", "Rigid/Rigid" or
			// "Mixed".
			//
			// This is the data encoding of a real rule: "Some pieces of armor come with their
			// own padding or flexible layer built in, such as skull caps and some gauntlets.
			// In these cases, it is acceptable to use one layer of rigid armor against the
			// body." A composite piece with a flexible inner face may therefore sit in the
			// first layer, which a plain rigid piece may not.
			//
			// "Rigid/Rigid" looks contradictory against the no-rigid-on-rigid rule, but the
			// rules allow it: "A few suits allow two sections of rigid armor because they do
			// not touch."
