// @START (CODE)
// @MARKER ITEM DIRECTORY
//==================================================================================================================
// Fills Foundry's Items sidebar with the system's content, in folders.
//
// The compendia remain the system's own copy and are what the importer maintains; this puts a
// working set in the world where a Game Master can see it, search it and drag from it. It is
// filled FROM THE COMPENDIA, so whatever is in them -- including gear a Game Master added by hand
// -- is what appears; the shipped JSON is only the fallback for a world whose compendia have not
// been imported yet. Daryl
// asked for it on 2026-09-21 after finding the sidebar empty, and it is the right answer to that:
// a compendium is a library, and a library you have to go and open is not where you reach for a
// sword mid-session.
//
// GROUPED THE WAY HIS OWN DATA GROUPS THINGS, where it groups them at all:
//
//     Weapons        his `type` -- Blade, Axe, Bludgeon, Pick, Piercer, Missile, Explosive, Special
//     Armour         shields first, then his flexibility classes
//     Skills         his class/social split, then the sourcebook each came from
//     Classes        his classType -- Warrior subclass, Mage subclass and the rest
//
// Equipment, races, abilities, disabilities and immunities have NO category in his tables: his
// equipment dictionary is a name and a weight and nothing else. Those are bucketed by initial
// letter instead, which is a way of finding things rather than a claim about the game, and is
// labelled as such below so nobody mistakes an A-C folder for one of his categories.
//==================================================================================================================

		// is loosed, not swung, and he gives it no swing. That is 317 of the 408. Each of those
		// names its launcher in its own brackets -- "Arrow(Long Bow/Normal)" -- which is both his
