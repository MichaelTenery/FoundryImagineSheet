// @START (CODE)
// @MARKER CLASS RULES
//==================================================================================================================
// Rules for what a class gives a character as it advances, with no Foundry dependency, so they can
// be tested outside it. The race half of the module lives in race-rules.mjs; this is the class half.
//
// HIS MODEL, which this follows. setClassSkillLists (sheet-worker.js:57903) gives a class its whole
// skill progression at once -- every skill, each tagged with the title it arrives at -- and
// setFinalClassSkills (63177) writes all fifteen titles onto the sheet at creation. Only the FIRST
// title's skills get a live ability and chance there; every later title's are written with
// "_ability"=0 and "_chance"=0 (63292, 63327, and so on down to 63692). They are on the sheet, and
// they do not work yet.
//
// A later title's skills come alive when the character reaches that title. handleLevelTitle (66058)
// asks getTitleToAcquireSkillsByGoal (92462) which title's skills a goal buys, and its answer is
// the plain title boundary -- goal 0 gives title 1, 3 gives 2, 6 gives 3, up to 42 giving 15 -- so
// reaching title N is exactly when title N's skills are acquired. That is what makes granting on
// the title faithful rather than a simplification.
//
// His two gates on USING one, from handleHighTitleClassSkillRoll (64169) and its Mod twin:
//     the skill's title is above the character's      "this skill cannot be used before <name> title."
//     the skill has no ability yet                    the roll falls back to the base chance alone
// The first is ported here as checkClassSkillTitle. The second needs no rule: a skill the character
// does not hold has no bonuses to read.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE. Whether the character has a free class skill slot for the skill. His sheet
// marks a skill "REMOVED" when the slots run short (63268), and the slot accounting already lives
// in skills-rules.mjs and _prepareSkillSlots; a grant that overruns is therefore reported by the
// slot panel that is already there, exactly as one made by hand is.
//==================================================================================================================

	// This is the function which decides whether a class skill is for this character at all.
	// His nocast, set by the racial disability "Cannot Cast Spells": a few casting classes give a

	// only one of them is ever this character's.

	// all back, class_skill_1_1 to class_skill_15_1 (125658) -- which is why a later title's skill
