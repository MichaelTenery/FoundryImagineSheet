// @START (CODE)
// @MARKER SHEET THEME
//==================================================================================================================
// Which palette the Imagine windows paint themselves in.
//
// The system's own look is cream paper with brown ink -- a deliberate choice, because a character
// sheet with this many numbers on it reads better as a printed page than as a dark panel, and
// because entered values and derived values are told apart by field-against-flat-text, which needs
// a light ground to work. That look is kept as the default.
//
// But it is not everyone's, and a Game Master running a dark table had the Imagine windows glaring
// out of an otherwise dark screen with no way to say otherwise. So it is a setting, and the other
// choice is simply to stop overriding: "Foundry standard" hands the colours back to whatever theme
// Foundry itself is using, light or dark, and the sheets follow the rest of the interface.
//
// THE CLASSES ARE PUT ON AT RENDER, not declared in DEFAULT_OPTIONS.classes. A window's static
// classes are fixed when it is constructed, so a sheet already open when the setting changed would
// have kept the old palette until it was closed and reopened. Doing it in _onRender means an
// ordinary re-render repaints it, which is what the setting's onChange asks every open window to do.
//==================================================================================================================

// The palettes, and what each puts on the window's root element.
//   paper     the system's own cream: Foundry's light theme variables, plus the overrides in
//             styles/imagine-rpg.css that this file's "themed"/"theme-light" pair switch on
//   foundry   no override at all: imagine-foundry maps the system's colour variables onto
//             Foundry's own, so the sheets take the interface's theme, dark or light

// is actually running is in front of everyone without opening Foundry's setup screen. On
// 2026-09-20 a fixed import error was reported twice from a stale install with nothing on screen to
// tell the builds apart; this is the same answer as the console line at init, made visible. A
// client setting, on by default, turns it off. Put on here because every Imagine window already
// calls applySheetTheme from _onRender, so each redraw keeps it -- and removes it when turned off.

// This is the function which reads the setting, on unless it says otherwise. Guarded for the same
// reasons getSheetTheme is.
