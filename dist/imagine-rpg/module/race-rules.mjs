// @START (CODE)
// @MARKER RACE RULES
//==================================================================================================================
// Rules for combining races, with no Foundry dependency, so they can be tested outside it.
//
// His sheet lets a character be of more than one race. race_type offers One Race, Half Race,
// Multi Race(3), Multi Race(4), Part Race and Trace Race (sheet-worker.js:32591-32726), but only
// Half Race is actually implemented: applyRaceToAttribs (32966) answers the other four with
// "not yet implemented. Nothing done." So Half Race is ported here from his code, and the others
// are not guessed at -- see UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md item 32.
//
// A Half Race is at least 40 percent each of two races (Player's Guide, Mixed Races, p.33). His
// applyHalfRaceToAttribs (33770) takes the two races' raceStatsAndMoveDetails rows and combines
// them field by field:
//
//     field                                  how                            where in his code
//     attribute modifiers                    averageTwoFloatsRounded        33889-33900
//     attribute maximums                     averageTwoFloatsRounded        33901-33912
//     starting Endurance modifier            averageTwoFloatsRounded        8147-8152
//     Endurance formulas (start, title)      kept as a "first|second" pair  33913-33926
//     Perception/Affinity/Fortune mods       averageTwoFloatsRounded        33927-33929
//     the five resistance mods               averageTwoFloatsRounded        33930-33934
//     speed multiplier, walk/jog/run mods    averageTwoFloatsRounded        33935-33947
//     special movement                       the FIRST race's, whole        33945-34000
//     standing and upward jump               averageTwoFloatsRounded        34001-34002
//     formless                               never -- "formless can't be half races"   34003
//     can swim                               if either race can             34004-34008
//
// "Averaged" is his averageTwoFloatsRounded, and it is not a plain average. It is the Player's
// Guide's own rule (Half Race, item 1): a modifier only one race has is taken in FULL, two
// bonuses are averaged rounding up, two penalties are averaged rounding towards the bigger
// penalty, and a bonus against a penalty is simply added.
//==================================================================================================================

	// This is the function which combines two races' figures the way his half race does. Ported
	// from averageTwoFloatsRounded (sheet-worker.js), branch for branch:

	//     both above 0                average, +.099, rounded      +3 and +1 give +2
	//     both below 0                average, -.099, rounded      -2 and -3 give -3
	//     anything else               the two ADDED, +.099, rounded   +2 and 0 give +2
	//
	// The .099 nudges a .5 the way he wants it before toFixed(0) rounds -- up for bonuses, away
	// from zero for penalties -- and his toFixedWithoutZeros turns the result back into a number.

	}

	// This is the function which builds the race a Half Race character actually has, out of the
	// two races' data. It returns the same shape as a race item's system data, so everything that
	// reads a race reads this unchanged.
	//
	// Two numbers are taken from the first race only, as the schema holds one number where he
	// holds a pair: titleMax and titleMod. Nothing in the port reads either yet -- the title
	// Endurance roll (his setNewCharacteristics) is not ported -- and his pair is kept whole in
	// titleFormula/titleDice beside them, so the second race's figures are not lost.
	// @MARKER SLIGHT PHYSIQUE
	// This is the function which gives back a race as a character of slight build has it.
	//
	// Slight Physique is a CHOICE on his Roll20 sheet, not a consequence of gender. The original
	// rules applied it to every female of every race; he cut it loose when he built the sheet, so a
	// slighter male and a stronger female are both ordinary characters. He confirmed this on
	// 2026-09-20, which is what closed UPSTREAM-ISSUES item 38.
	//
	// For almost every race the choice is only -1 Strength and +1 Agility, which applyPhysique
	// handles on the ratings and which never touches the race. Five races carry a second
	// difference, and it is always a TRADE rather than a bonus:
	//     Fairy, Fairy(Dark)   wings in the slight form; the wingless form gains two racial skills
	//                          instead -- Climb and Cover Tracks for a Fairy, Climb and Wood Lore
	//                          +10% for a Dark Fairy
	//     Podling, Sporeling   wings in the slight form, no skill difference
	//     Gremlin              flies either way; the ORDINARY form gains Climb
	//
	// @MARKER RACE FORMS
	// This is the function which says whether a character's race decides their physique for them.
	//
	// Four faerie races are split into a winged form and a wingless one, because in his code the
	// wings ARE the slight-physique branch -- his slight branch sets "Fly:" where his ordinary one
	// sets "None:". Michael's call, 2026-09-21: they are one choice, not two. So a winged form
	// forces the tick on and a wingless form forces it off, and the generator stops offering it.
	//
	// Takes the race systems a character holds -- one, or the two halves of a Half Race, BEFORE
	// they are combined, since combining loses which document each half came from. Returns what the
	// tick must be, whether it is the character's to set, and why.
	//
	// A Half Race can hold one of each, and there is no answer that is not wrong for one parent.
	// That is REPORTED rather than refused, which is what the port already does with a barred class
	// and an infertile pair: the tick is left as the player set it and the header says so.
