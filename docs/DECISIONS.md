# Decisions Log

Append-only. One entry per real architectural or scope call. Newest at the bottom. If a decision is later reversed, add a new entry noting the reversal rather than editing the old one.

---

### 2026-09-10 — Source of truth on conflicts
**Decision:** When the Roll20 sheet (`ImagineRoll20CharacterSheet-main/`) disagrees with a rulebook, the Roll20 sheet wins.
**Rationale:** The sheet reflects what the table actually plays with, which may include years of house rules or errata the books never caught up to.

### 2026-09-10 — Target platform
**Decision:** Foundry VTT V14 (current stable line as of 2026-09).
**Rationale:** User wants latest; V14 confirmed as current stable via web search (build 14.367).

### 2026-09-10 — Visual direction
**Decision:** Redesign the sheet UI for Foundry's native conventions (tabs, theming, resizable windows) rather than cloning the Roll20 sheet's boxy table layout.
**Rationale:** User's explicit call — "Redesign for Foundry."

### 2026-09-10 — Build scope / phasing
**Decision:** "Core first" — Attributes, Races & Classes, Skills, Character Generation, Combat, Equipment, Creature/NPC actor type. The 20+ magic/crafting subsystems (runes, potions, elixirs, charms, poisons, bardic magic, empathy magic, glyphs, rituals, sympathy magic, etc.) and base Magic/Divine Magic are deferred to a later phase.
**Rationale:** User's explicit call, given the scale (40+ tabs/subsystems in the source sheet).

### 2026-09-10 — CORRECTION: the Roll20 sheet does contain JavaScript
**What happened:** Earlier analysis this same day concluded `ImagineTabbedCharacterSheet.html` had zero `<script>` tags and was a "logic-less" sheet with inert ROLL/MOD buttons. That was wrong. The search used to check for scripts matched the literal text `&lt;script` (an HTML-escaped entity) instead of the actual tag `<script`, producing a false negative. The file has a single `<script type="text/worker">` block running from line 98843 to the end of the file (279214) — **180,370 lines, ~13MB**, the actual Roll20 sheet-worker JavaScript, confirmed by the developer directly ("It has a huge data dictionary in it. It is most certainly JS code.").
**Impact:** Extracted to `docs/reference/sheet-worker.js`. This is dev-authored, battle-tested computation code — a stronger source of truth than the OCR'd rulebooks for anything it covers, per the existing "Roll20 wins on conflict" rule (this IS the Roll20 sheet, just a part of it I'd missed). Initial spot-checks (attribute save formula, Endurance formula) match my book-derived reconstructions almost exactly, which is a good validation signal for the reconstructions done before this was found, but this file should be treated as primary from here forward, not the books, wherever it has coverage.
**What's in it (initial survey, not exhaustive):** ~37 major data dictionaries including full weapon stats (`weaponvalueslist`), a per-body-location armor value table across ~19 distinct locations (`armorvalueslist`), armor costs/penalties/condition/blocking/damage-type/materials (5 more dictionaries), the complete class/racial skill table (`skilldict`), five social-skill dictionaries, martial arts (8 dictionaries: attack/block/hold/move/throw/lore/stances), hand-to-hand and brawling tables, class title/advancement data (`classtitledict`), fatigue, and — notably — magic-phase content already present: `rituallist`, `evokedict`, `spellPrimers`. Full catalog not yet done.
**Not yet resolved:** whether `getArmorCombatValues` and the rest of this file represent the dev's *current* intended ruleset, or an older/divergent version he's since moved past — worth asking him directly given he referenced it from memory rather than sending it.

### 2026-09-10 — Rules source material
**Decision:** Building from two books so far: `IRP_playersguide.pdf` (368 pages — base rules: Attributes, Races, Characters, Classes, Skills, Combat, Equipment, Magic, Divine Magic, Appendix) and `IRP_mastersmanual_scan.pdf` (319 pages — GM-facing expansion: extended attribute ranges 0-4/21-30, class "extensions," expanded combat, equipment costs, magic item design, new spells/invocations, world-building). Full OCR text of both extracted to `docs/reference/`. More books (Bestiary, per-subsystem magic books) expected later, needed only when their corresponding phase starts.
**Rationale:** The Master's Manual alone was insufficient — it explicitly defers to "the Player's Guide" 82+ times for base mechanics, including for the normal 5-20 attribute range every character actually uses.

### 2026-09-10 — Publishing / IP rights
**Decision:** Public release is in scope. User confirmed full permission from the rights holder (the game's developer) to build and publish this conversion.
**Rationale:** User's explicit statement. Worth keeping that permission documented somewhere (e.g. an email) before actual package-browser submission, but this is not a current blocker.

### 2026-09-10 — Data migration
**Decision:** No automated Roll20 → Foundry character import tooling. Existing characters will be migrated manually by hand.
**Rationale:** User's explicit call — lower priority than getting the system itself right.

### 2026-09-10 — Content architecture: compendium-driven, sourcebook-tagged
**Decision:** Classes, Races, Skills, Equipment, and (later) Magic subsystems are NOT hardcoded. They live as Foundry compendium entries tagged by sourcebook of origin (e.g. "Player's Guide," "Master's Manual," "Custom"). A campaign/world can enable or disable entire sourcebooks or override individual entries. New content (stock or homebrew) is added by authoring/importing compendium entries — no code changes required.
**Rationale:** User needs to add new classes/races/content as the system (their own game) is still in active development, and wants per-class and per-sourcebook enable/disable, not just a binary on/off. Generalized from an initial "turn classes on/off" request into a shared content layer used everywhere, per user's explicit confirmation ("Apply broadly").

### 2026-09-10 — Magic subsystem toggles
**Decision:** Each of the 20+ magic/crafting subsystems is individually toggleable, plus a single master "all magic off" switch that short-circuits all of them regardless of individual settings.
**Rationale:** User's explicit call. Mirrors the Roll20 sheet's own Config tab pattern (`act_configtabA`), which likely served a similar purpose originally.

### 2026-09-10 — Working protocol: model choice for heavy work
**Decision:** Before starting real implementation work (non-trivial rules encoding, architecture-locking decisions, substantive system code — as opposed to planning, research, or light scaffolding), stop and ask the user whether to proceed on Opus or Fable rather than defaulting to whatever model is currently active.
**Rationale:** User's explicit call. Also saved as a persistent feedback memory outside this repo, since it's a working-style preference rather than project data.

### 2026-09-10 — Foundry V14 technical baseline
**Decision:** Build exclusively on ApplicationV2 + HandlebarsApplicationMixin (no legacy AppV1 classes, which are slated for removal at V16). Design the Active-Effect-backed modifier system against V14's string-based change types (`"add"`/`"multiply"`/`"override"`, under `effect.system.changes`) from day one, not the old numeric constants. Use `DocumentUUIDField` (with `relative: true` where appropriate) as the native mechanism for cross-referencing compendium content (e.g. a Class item pointing at its racial skills), rather than hand-rolled UUID strings. Full research notes in `docs/reference/foundry-v14-requirements.md`.
**Rationale:** These are V14-specific APIs; building against the old patterns would mean redoing Layer 0 almost immediately. Confirmed via official Foundry docs and V14 migration references — see the reference doc for sources.
**Update 2026-09-10:** User confirmed no legacy/back-compat concern at all — target V14+ only, `compatibility.minimum` set strictly to `"14"`, no shims or fallback paths for AppV1 or pre-V14 APIs anywhere in the codebase.

### 2026-09-10 — Manifest scaffolding (Sonnet pass)
**Decision:** `system.json` id is `imagine-rpg`. Manifest declares `compatibility.minimum: "14"` (no `maximum`, to avoid locking out point releases), `documentTypes.Actor` with `character`/`creature` subtypes backed by deliberately empty `TypeDataModel` stub classes in `module/imagine-rpg.mjs`. Folder skeleton created: `module/`, `styles/`, `lang/`, `packs/`, `templates/`, each with a placeholder file. `license` manifest field intentionally omitted — no LICENSE file exists yet, and the license text is the rights holder's call, not mine to invent. `readme` field points at the existing `README.md`.
**Rationale:** This is the "Sonnet bit" of Layer 0 — mechanical, well-specified, low-risk to redo. The real Actor schema (what actually goes in `defineSchema()`) is explicitly deferred as an Opus task per the model protocol; these stubs exist only so the package is structurally loadable, not as a design commitment.
**Caveat:** Not yet runtime-verified against an actual Foundry V14 install — only JSON-validated and checked against the manifest spec in `docs/reference/foundry-v14-requirements.md`.

### 2026-09-10 — Working protocol: agile board + self-check loop
**Decision:** Track work in `docs/PROGRESS.md` as an agile-style board (epics = module layers, stories = concrete tasks, each with a Definition of Done). Every work loop ends with a self-check pass before a story is marked done: verify the implementation against `docs/reference/` (the actual rulebook text) and against the Roll20 sheet (which wins on conflict), confirm the story's Definition of Done is met, update `PROGRESS.md` status, log any new architectural call here, and commit.
**Rationale:** User's explicit call — continuity across conversation windows, and a repeatable quality gate rather than ad hoc self-review.

### 2026-09-10 — Column maps derived from code, not transcribed
**Decision:** Column names for the extracted dictionaries are derived from how the sheet-worker *consumes* each row (`setAttrs({field: row[N]})`), via `tools/extract/derive_column_maps.py`, rather than hand-transcribed. `map_columns.py --check` treats any row-width mismatch as an error.
**Why it matters:** Several important dictionaries carry no column-header comment at all — `raceStatsAndMoveDetails` has 62 unlabelled columns and `classRequirementsAndDetails` has 22. Hand-transcribing those invites an off-by-one somewhere in the middle, which does not fail loudly; it silently shifts every subsequent field and surfaces much later as wrong game numbers. Deriving from his code is both faster and authoritative.
**Validation caught real errors:** four of the twelve attribute-table maps were wrong when inferred from the printed rulebook tables — `appRatingValues`, `aurRatingValues`, `ptyRatingValues` and `wilRatingValues` each carry extra "special" columns that the printed tables do not show. The width check caught all four.

### 2026-09-10 — Found a live defect in the dev's class data
**Finding:** `classRequirementsAndDetails["Monk"]` has 21 columns; all 87 other classes have 22. Monk carries only 4 `classMod` slots (indices 11-14) where every other class has 5 (11-15), so every field after that point is shifted left by one.
**Live consequence:** his sheet reads `classDetails[16]` as armour usage. For Monk, index 16 holds the weapon list — so Monk's armour usage is displaying weapon data in the current Roll20 sheet.
**Decision:** left unmapped and reported rather than patched. Guessing where the missing column belongs means silently altering his game data; the fix is almost certainly inserting one empty `classMod` slot, but that is his call to confirm.

### 2026-09-10 — Rulebook text kept out of the public repository
**Decision:** The four extracted rulebook full-text files are untracked and `.gitignore`d. They stay on local disk and are regenerated with `tools/extract/extract_book_text.py`. His `sheet-worker.js` and the Roll20 sheet **remain** committed.
**Rationale:** `MichaelTenery/FoundryImagineSheet` is a public repository. Committing the complete text of four commercial titles would let anyone read the Player's Guide without buying it — materially different from publishing a Foundry system, and not something the permission to build this conversion reasonably covers.
**Where the line falls:** code stays, books go. His sheet code is the system's primary source of truth and the conversion depends on it; it is also already embedded inside the committed Roll20 HTML, so removing one copy would achieve nothing. The books are prose he sells.
**Known limitation:** the text was already pushed in commit `24f14a7` and remains in git history. Removing it properly needs a history rewrite and force-push — destructive, and on someone else's public repository, so it is the rights holder's call rather than one to take unilaterally. Worth doing soon if at all, while the history is short.
**Also his call, not ours:** whether the repository should be private at this stage.

### 2026-09-11 — CORRECTION: the Roll20 Config tab has no content toggles
The "Magic subsystem toggles" entry above says the design "mirrors the Roll20 sheet's own Config tab pattern (`act_configtabA`), which likely served a similar purpose originally." That was a guess, and it was wrong. His Config tab (HTML lines 57259-57377) covers sheet style, colour scheme, equipment handling (Realistic / Loose / Free, which only switches the equipment layout shown), attack verbosity and experience display. It has no magic or sourcebook switches. The availability layer is new functionality, not a port.

### 2026-09-11 — Content availability layer
**Decision:** `module/availability.mjs` implements one pure resolver, `explainAvailability(item, rules)`, returning `{ available, reason }`. The rules are four world settings edited through a Game Master window (`module/apps/availability-config.mjs`). The checks run in a fixed order:
1. **Magic switches** — the master switch, then one switch per subsystem. These are a hard ceiling, and nothing below them can lift it.
2. **Individual overrides** — allow or forbid one item, keyed `type:name` (e.g. `class:Monk`).
3. **Sourcebooks** — whole books on or off.

**Rationale and sub-decisions:**
- *Magic is absolute.* `DECISIONS` already specified that the master switch "short-circuits all of them regardless of individual settings." An allow-override therefore cannot re-enable a magical skill with magic off, which is what makes the switch worth having.
- *A skill with several magic types needs all of them enabled.* "Arch Ritual" is `Magical,Divine`, so it disappears if either arcane or divine magic is off. The reading is strict: something that needs magic cannot be used without it.
- *Overrides are keyed by `type:name`, not UUID.* A UUID changes when a compendium item is copied onto an actor or a pack is rebuilt. A name survives both, and a Game Master can read it in the settings window.
- *Untagged content is always available at the sourcebook level.* His races, classes, weapons, armour and equipment carry no sourcebook in the source data. Tags are not invented, so untagged content can only be forbidden individually.
- *Unlisted means on.* A sourcebook or subsystem missing from the settings defaults to enabled, so content from a book added later appears rather than silently vanishing.
- *Sourcebook identity is a slug.* His data writes `Player`s Guide` with a backtick, so it and `Player's Guide` must land on the same key.
- *Nothing is deleted.* When a switch flips, items already on a character are flagged unavailable, and the sheet shows the reason. Removing a player's things as a side effect of a settings change is not acceptable.
- *Enforcement sits on item creation* (`preCreateItem`), not on a drop handler, so it holds however an item arrives. Players are blocked. A Game Master is let through with a warning, because they decide what is in the campaign and may be making a deliberate exception. For the same reason, the sheet does not disable Roll on flagged items; it only marks them.

**Subsystem grouping:** 16 switches, each recording which of his Roll20 repeating sections it covers (e.g. `herbalism` = herb, potion, elixir, potionrecipe), so the grouping can be checked against his sheet or split further. This grouping is a judgement call and is cheap to change, since it is one list.

### 2026-09-11 — Combat, phase 1
**Decision:** Combat is built as pure rule functions (`module/combat/combat-rules.mjs`, with no Foundry dependency, each ported from a named place in his code) plus a thin Foundry layer (`combat/attack.mjs`, `combat/combat-document.mjs`). The tables are generated from his code rather than transcribed, by `tools/extract/extract_combat_tables.py` into `module/combat-tables.mjs`: the seven attack charts, 45 body charts, armour blocking, degradation dividers and material rank. Several lived inside `switch` statements rather than dictionaries and are read by walking those functions.

**How an attack resolves** (his `handlePhysicalAttacks`): d20 plus modifiers, floored at 1, read down a fixed ladder of zones (centre, right, high, left, low, then the misses), so one roll decides both hit and location. A called shot is judged on the *natural* roll; a natural 1 is a fumble. The attacker declares an aimed area. A centre hit lands there. An off-centre hit is placed by the Game Master when damage is applied, because the book describes superimposing the bullseye on the target and his code only ever reports the zone.

**How damage lands** (his `handleBodyDamage`): banded blocking against the total armour at the struck area, armour degradation worked from the damage *before* blocking, then hide. Wounds are capped at area Endurance plus Vitality. Past Endurance a Vitality save is needed; past Endurance plus Vitality the area's effect triggers; total wounds over Shock means shock.

**The 10-second round:** initiative is the second a combatant starts acting (d10, plus the better of the Agility and Intelligence adjustments, plus armour). The tracker sorts lowest first, and spending an action's seconds moves a combatant later and re-sorts. It is built on Foundry's own tracker rather than a separate clock.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *Body areas are derived; wounds are stored by name.* Areas come from the race's body chart, or from an explicit body-type override for transformations. Wounds and armour damage are `TypedObjectField`s keyed by area name, so a change of body cannot slide wounds onto the wrong limbs. This replaces the earlier stored `areas[]` array, which nothing used yet.
- *The standard attack chart stops at Master.* A class listing "Grandmaster(mastered weapons at 9)" means Grandmaster only on the Weapon Lore chart, as his code states explicitly.
- *The target's defensive adjustment is applied* when exactly one target is selected. It is not in his code, whose sheet only ever knew one character, but it is in the book and Foundry knows the target. It can be switched off per attack.
- *Humanoid armour maps to areas by name.* Humanoid, its variants and Saurian share the 19 location names. Other body types take no protection from humanoid armour until his per-body-type mapping is ported.
- *Where his code has a plain bug, the port implements the evident intent* and the bug is listed in `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 6. Where the book and his code simply disagree, his code is followed and the difference is listed in item 7.

**Deferred to phase 2:** Weapon/Missile Lore charts, martial arts and stances, multi-missile, soldiering, runes, the magic armours (spirit, force, invulnerability, magic shield, weaves), shield coverage by handedness, pain threshold, damage absorption, special damage effects such as losing an eye, the critical fumble table, the per-body-type armour mapping, carry-over, and evoke mutations on the body.

### 2026-09-11 — CORRECTION: parenthesised weapon values are not a "second head"
An earlier entry, and `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 5, said values like `8(6)` and `5d6(2d6)` were a dual-headed weapon's second head. His code says otherwise, and the data agrees:
- **Parenthesised damage** appears on exactly two weapons, and his code names both: a Spear does its bracketed damage when *thrown*, an Axe Hammer when *thrusting*. It is now stored as `damageAlt` together with the `damageAltMode` it applies to.
- **Parenthesised speed** appears on 85 weapons, almost all bows and crossbows, and it is **reload time**: a Crossbow is `1(15)`, firing in 1 second and reloading in 15. It is now `reloadSpeed` / `reloadMinSpeed`.

The `alternateHead` field is removed.

### 2026-09-11 — Creature/NPC audit findings (research pass, before schema design)

> **Several statements in this entry are wrong.** They came from research summaries that were logged before being checked against the source. Read "CORRECTION: creature audit findings, checked against the source" below before relying on anything here.

**What was done:** Two research passes, one over the Roll20 HTML's creature sheet (lines 57576-92926, ~35,352 lines across 10 sub-tabs), one over `sheet-worker.js`'s `// @MARKER CREATURE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS BELOW` section (lines 174658-180370) plus the shared functions elsewhere that branch on creature vs. character. No schema written yet — this logs what was confirmed, so the eventual schema design starts from fact rather than re-deriving it.

**Character vs. Creature is a hand-rolled toggle, not a Roll20-native distinction.** `sheet.json` declares nothing about it. The developer built his own: a `attr_which_sheet` dropdown ("Character Sheet" / "Creature Sheet") sets `attr_overall_sheet` to `main_character` or `main_creature`, which gates two entirely separate `<div>` bodies via CSS classes, each with its own independent tab system (`attr_sheetTab` vs `attr_sheetTab2`). This maps cleanly onto Foundry's real actor-type system — nothing about the split needs to be preserved as ambiguous.

**Confirmed shared with Character (same shape, reusable as-is):**
- The same 12 attributes and the same `getAttribSave()` branch order — already ported, applies unchanged.
- The body-area/wound/armor-layer system. `rebuildRepeatingBodyRows` and `checkTotalWounds` (both *outside* the creature marker section — shared code) branch on `creature_type` only to pick which Endurance field feeds `createBodyAreas`, then call the identical function Character uses. `BODY_CHARTS` in `module/combat-tables.mjs` already contains every stock creature body-chart string, verified byte-for-byte against `getBodyList`'s switch cases. **No new body-chart work is needed for stock body types.**
- Attack resolution. `setCreatureAttackSkillValues` uses an inline table character-for-character identical to `ATTACK_CHARTS`; `handleCreatureAttack` walks the same zone-ladder fields in the same order as the already-ported `resolveAttack`, with the same three-tier fumble structure as `resolveFumble`. The only difference is that a creature's attack-chart level is a directly-authored stat (`creature_atk_chart`), not derived from class progression. **`getAttackChart`, `resolveAttack` and `resolveFumble` are very likely reusable as-is for Creature.**

**Confirmed creature-specific (needs new schema/logic):**
- Identity: type/subtype/level/lifecycle/habitat/bodytype, with real enums recovered from the Configurator tab (creature types: Animal/Deity/Humanoid/Magical/Magical Animal/Magical Humanoid/Magical Plant/Plant/Slime/Supernatural/Undead; body types include Arachen/Bird/Brachara/Centaur/Crustacean/Giant Spider/etc.).
- The attribute cap is level-tiered (25/28/30), not title-tiered like Character's — see `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 8.
- Characteristics are a mixed bag, not uniformly derived like Character's: **Endurance and Hide are flat authored numbers** with no attribute-averaging formula at all; **Shock** derives as `END × 3` only as a fallback when no value is entered; **Perception/Affinity/Fortune are derived**, reusing the same attribute-average-plus-`.99` idiom as Character, but with an added `+creature_level` term, ability-name-triggered `+10` bonuses, and (Affinity only) a conditional formula and a `tame_bonus` term Character has no equivalent of. **Resistances are flat authored percentages plus additive modifiers, not attribute-table lookups at all** — a genuine structural break from `_prepareResistances`.
- The 10-slot hardcoded natural-attack block (`creature_attk_one`..`ten`) is not shaped like a weapon Item — it's a custom `|`/`^`/`@`-delimited encoded string (name/type/speed/minspeed/damage/damtype, plus optional rider blocks for effects like poison). It also supports non-physical attack shapes with no Character equivalent at all: `Touch` (auto-resolve, no roll), `Direct`/`Gaze`/`Voice` (auto-hit), `Cloud`/`Bolt`/`Cone`/`Glob` (an area/shape whose size is computed from the creature's own Endurance). This needs its own schema, not a reuse of the weapon Item type.
- `abilitylist` (1,119 creature-scale entries), `disabilitylist` (249), `immunitylist` (149, byte-identical to its Character-scale twin) are **flavor-text lookup tables, not mechanical-effect data**. A creature stores one comma-separated name string per category; the dictionaries are consulted only to fetch display description text. Where an ability does have a real mechanical effect today, it's a hand-coded substring check on the flattened name list (`calcAllCreatureCaracs`, e.g. `.includes("Enhanced Perception")`), not something driven generically by the dictionaries' own value columns (see `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 10). **This means "port Abilities the way Skills were ported" (a described Item, looked up for display) is a faithful port; making Abilities automatically grant Active Effects would be new functionality beyond what his sheet does, not a like-for-like port** — flagging this distinction because it's exactly the kind of framing that's easy to blur without the audit.
- Powers (`usePower`) are not driven by a shared dictionary the way Abilities are — each is authored per-creature with its own name/uses/self-target/type. Some Powers resolve through the *same* attack-chart threshold fields `handleCreatureAttack` uses, meaning Powers and Attacks aren't cleanly separate concepts in his code.

**Deferred, confirmed out of scope for now:** the EXP/CR budgeting functions (`calcCreatureExp` and its sub-tables) are a creature-design aid, not a play-time mechanic — lower priority than Layers 0-3. The Magiclore2 tab (~10,000 lines) mirrors the same 20+ deferred Layer-4 magic subsystems already deferred for Character; not catalogued field-by-field since Layer 4 as a whole is deferred. The five dynamically-built "Famorian/Evoked" body types are the same "evoke mutations" gap already noted as not-yet-implemented for Character — shared gap, not new scope.

**Open questions logged for a decision before the schema is locked** (tracked as the next step, not resolved by this entry):
1. Ability/Disability/Immunity: plain descriptive Items (faithful port) vs. Active-Effect-granting Items (a capability upgrade beyond his sheet).
2. Powers vs. Attacks: one item type or two, given Powers sometimes resolve through the attack-chart machinery.
3. Whether a creature needs an owner/relationship field for the "tamed creature" case implied by `tame_bonus` in the Affinity formula.
4. The attribute-cap tier reconciliation (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 8) is the developer's call, not ours to guess at.

### 2026-09-11 — Creature schema: the three open design calls, resolved

**Decisions**, each the user's explicit call, closing the open questions from the audit entry above:

1. **Abilities/Disabilities/Immunities are plain descriptive items.** They get a name and description field, looked up for display exactly like his sheet does today — a faithful port, not an upgrade. Any future mechanical effect is added later as an explicit, individually-authored Active Effect on that specific item, never generated automatically from the dictionary's `[1]`/`[2]` columns. This matches how Skills already work and keeps the port honest to what his sheet actually does (see the "Ability/Disability/Immunity dictionaries" finding above and `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 10).
2. **Powers and Attacks are two separate item types.** Even though `usePower` sometimes resolves a Power through the same attack-chart threshold fields `handleCreatureAttack` uses, the two stay conceptually distinct items — an Attack is a weapon or natural-weapon strike; a Power is a limited-use special ability that may, internally, roll against the attack chart. Mirrors his sheet's own separately-authored data for each.
3. **The tamed-creature/owner-relationship concept (the `tame_bonus` term in the Affinity formula) is deferred.** This pass builds the stat-block fields only; owner-relationship modeling (taming, loyalty, etc.) is left for a later pass, consistent with the project's core-first phasing.

**Model choice:** the user picked **Fable** for the real schema/rules implementation (per the working protocol's model check-in). This research-and-decisions pass was done on Sonnet, which the protocol allows for research/planning; the actual `module/data/actor-creature.mjs` and its sheet are Fable's to write. **A conversation window running as Sonnet should not write that code** — hand off to a window running as Fable instead.

### 2026-09-11 — CORRECTION: creature audit findings, checked against the source

The audit entry above was written from two research summaries without being checked line by line. A review pass (run on Opus) checked each of its mechanical claims against `sheet-worker.js` and the HTML. Incidental details, such as how many lines the magic tab runs to, were not rechecked. Most held up: the hand-rolled sheet toggle, the 12 shared attributes and `getAttribSave`, flat resistances with modifiers and the "Immune" check, the 25/28/30 level cap, the attack chart table matching `ATTACK_CHARTS` row for row, the zone ladder and fumble handling, the `|`/`@`/`^` attack encoding, the non-physical attack shapes sized from Endurance, the 45 static body charts matching `BODY_CHARTS` byte for byte, identical immunity lists, and the creature-type enum. The following did not hold up.

**Where the creature code lives.** `rebuildRepeatingBodyRows` (line 178211) and `createBodyAreas` (180208) are *inside* the creature marker section, not outside it, although Character code calls them too. The marker marks where he put code, not what it is used for. `checkTotalWounds` (121709) branches on `creature_type` to pick the **body type** field, not the Endurance field. `rebuildRepeatingBodyRows` means to pick the Endurance field, but it never fetches `creature_type`, so its creature branch never runs (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 12).

**Endurance, Hide and Shock are copied into the shared fields.** `handleCreatureFinish` writes the creature's figures to `creature_end`/`creature_hide`/`creature_shock` *and* to Character's `endurance`/`hide`/`shock` (lines 174945-174950). That is how the shared combat header and body code serve both sheets.

**Characteristics, precisely** (`calcAllCreatureCaracs`, 178346; the same arithmetic runs in `handleCreatureFinish`):
- Endurance = the entered figure + the temporary Endurance modifier. Hide = the entered figure. Shock = the entered figure, or "Immune" if it contains "imm", or, if zero, the entered Endurance × 3 (before the temporary modifier).
- Perception = average(INT, WIS, KNW) rounded up with `+.99`, + level, +10 for "Enhanced Perception", +5 each for the skills Smell, Listen and Life Sense, and +5 per ability whose name contains "Sense" or "Sensing" (Life Sense counted once).
- Affinity = average(APP, CHM, SOC), or average(APP, CHM) when Social Class is 0, + **level × 2** (not level), +10 for "Enhanced Affinity", + the tame bonus.
- Fortune = average(AUR, PTY, WIL) + level, +10 for "Enhanced Fortune".
- Then each gets its temporary modifier.
- All three averages use the creature's **as-built** attributes (`new_intelligence` and so on), not its current ones. A temporary change to a creature's Intelligence does not move its Perception. Character works the other way: an effect on an attribute cascades into everything derived from it.

**Attacks.**
- A Touch attack is *not* resolved without a roll. It rolls d20 plus the Agility missile modifier, and touches on 10 or more unless the die shows 1 (`handleTouchAttack`, 67731).
- Only Direct, Gaze and Voice skip the attack chart. Cloud and Cone still roll on it.
- Missile, Glob and Bolt use missile modifiers; everything else uses melee.
- Each attack can carry up to three effect blocks after its main block.
- His creature to-hit arithmetic has a precedence bug that normally wipes the Strength or Agility modifier (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 11). The port should follow `handlePhysicalAttacks`, which sums each modifier separately.

**Body charts.** The body type is not the whole story. A creature's body chart is a stored, editable list (`new_bodyarea_list`). The configurator seeds it from `getBodyList` and lets the Game Master add or remove areas, and "Custom" is a body type (lines 22291-22361). The creature schema therefore has to store its own chart, not only a body type to look up. Separately, five insect charts write `Vital:2` without the `x`, which currently gives those areas x1 (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 9).

**The ability dictionaries are not just flavour text.** That was true of the creature path only. The racial copies drive a hand-written switch (`setTempRacialAbilities`, 46293, and its disability and immunity twins) that sets a flag per ability and reads `[1]`/`[2]` for hide values, infravision distance and others. The creature path never runs it (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 10). The two lists have also drifted apart in names and values. The creature ability list has **1,114** entries (1,119 lines, because 5 keys repeat with identical rows), not 1,119.

**Powers are innate spells and invocations.** A Power is *not* authored independently of any dictionary. `usePower` (177399) looks its name up in the spell dictionary, then the invocation dictionary, and does nothing if it is neither. It casts with the creature's power level, which equals its level, passed in where a caster's Aura (for a spell) or total Piety Control (for an invocation) would go. The side chances his casting code checks are fixed at 100: aura absorption for spells, and bless, blasphemy and divine knowledge for invocations. It uses up a use unless the Power is "Infinite". The attack-chart fields are passed in because attack spells roll on the chart through `doMagicalAttack`, exactly as they do when a Character casts them. It is *not* because Powers overlap with Attacks. The same `usePower` also runs magic-item and divine-item powers.

**Effect on the three design decisions above.** All three still stand:
1. *Abilities as plain descriptive items* fits even better than the original reasoning said. His racial switch *is* per-ability, hand-written mechanics, which is exactly what "an individually authored Active Effect on that specific item" ports to. For creatures, the faithful port is display only, plus the few substring bonuses computed as derived data. One compendium will need a decision on which list's row wins where they disagree.
2. *Powers and Attacks as separate item types* is now clear-cut, since a Power is a spell or invocation rather than a kind of attack. It has a scope consequence: a Power can be stored and shown now (name, uses, whether it targets self), but *using* one needs the spell and invocation engine, which is Layer 4 and deferred.
3. *Tamed creatures deferred* is unchanged.

### 2026-09-11 — Creature/NPC implementation

**Decision:** the creature actor is built as `module/data/actor-creature.mjs` plus three new item types, a sheet of its own, and a creature-only rules module. Implementation ran on Opus, at the user's direction, after the model check-in the working protocol requires.

**What a creature stores rather than derives.** This is the shape of the whole thing: a character *derives* Endurance, resistances and its attack skill from attributes, race and class, while a creature carries them as stat-block figures. So Endurance, Hide, Shock and all five resistances are entered fields with modifier slots, the attack chart is chosen outright, and each skill is a name and a flat percentage. What is still derived: attribute saves and table modifiers (the same functions a character uses), Perception, Affinity and Fortune, the body's areas, encumbrance and the standing combat numbers.

**Sub-decisions, each with its reason:**
- *Skills are a list on the actor, not Items.* A creature's skill is a name and a percentage — "Ambush 55%" — with no content behind it, and recomputing it from attributes would contradict the printed stat block. `parseSkillList` reads his own "Name 45%, Name 30%" format so a block can be pasted in. The cost is that the content switches cannot flag a creature's magical skill, since there is no item to flag; his sheet never filtered creature skills either, so nothing is lost against the original. Revisit if creature skills ever need compendium identity.
- *Abilities, disabilities and immunities are one item type, `trait`, with a category.* They are one shape in his data — three dictionaries with identical columns — so three item types would be three copies of one schema. `value1`/`value2` stay strings because their meaning is per entry, not per column (a damage multiplier of ".5" in one row, a resistance penalty of -10 in another).
- *Attacks and Powers are Items*, per the earlier decision. An attack being an Item is what lets a Bite live in a compendium and carry its own roll button. A creature's attacks in his data are an encoded string (`|` between attacks, `^` between fields, `@` before each of up to three rider effects); that decodes into the schema rather than being stored as text.
- *Perception, Affinity and Fortune are worked out from the creature's ratings, not its modified values*, because his formulas read the as-built attributes. A temporary attribute change therefore does not move them, where for a character it cascades. Faithful, documented at the code, and a one-line change if he wants it to cascade.
- *Where his helper is broken, the port implements the evident intent.* `divideWithMinAndMax` never applies its maximum (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 13), so a Bolt's reach is unbounded in his sheet; the port caps it. Same policy as combat phase 1.
- *A called shot halves a creature's damage*, matching the character port and the book, though his creature path does not (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 15). This is the one place the creature port deliberately departs from his creature code, on the grounds that one rule should not change meaning depending on who is attacking.
- *Powers are stored and listed but not resolved.* A Power is an innate spell or invocation, so using one needs the spell and invocation engine — the deferred magic phase. The Use button spends a use and says plainly that the Game Master resolves the effect, rather than pretending to cast it.
- *The attack card reuses the weapon card's flag shape*, so Apply Damage and Spend Seconds work on a creature attack with no new wiring.

**Not ported, deliberately:** the EXP/CR budgeting functions (a creature-design aid, not a play-time mechanic), the evoke and Famorian body builders (a gap shared with the character model), the Agility-driven jump table, and the +20 resistance flags that only the character side ever sets.

### 2026-09-11 — CORRECTION: a character's attribute maximum follows his sheet, not the Master's Manual

**What was wrong:** the character model capped each attribute at the *lower* of a Master's Manual tier by title — 23 mundane, 25 mortal, 27 arch-mortal, 30 deity — and the race's own limit. Those tiers came from the book. His sheet does not implement them, and the standing rule is that the sheet wins.

**What his sheet actually does**, in two places:
- The race's limits become the twelve maximums when a race is chosen (`str_tmp_limit` and its siblings, sheet-worker.js:8099). Before a race is picked they stand at 20 (`clearAttributeModifiersFinals`, line 32502).
- `setArchMortalAttributesMax` (line 27549), called once on titling to 11 (line 66140), replaces all twelve with a flat **27**, discarding the racial limits — upwards as well as downwards.

Nothing else caps an attribute by title. There is no deity handler at title 16, and no 23 or 25 tier anywhere. Every assignment to a `*_max` attribute was checked.

**Decision:** `getAttributeCap(title)` is replaced by `getAttributeMax(title, raceLimit)`: the race's limit, or 20 with no race, and a flat 27 from title 11. His code fires the replacement once at exactly title 11 and the value persists; a derived model recomputes continuously, so the port tests "title 11 or more", which reproduces the same resulting state. The book's tiers are gone from the code, and `IMAGINE.attributeCaps` with them.

**This changes play, in both directions.** An arch-mortal of a limited race gains real headroom — a race capped at 18 in Strength could never pass 18 before and now reaches 27. A low-title character of a permissive race is no longer held to 25 by a tier that does not exist in his sheet.

**Found by:** the review pass over the creature audit, not by the character work itself, which is why it survived Layer 0 and combat phase 1 unnoticed. His own comment at the call site says the new maximum is 25 while the function sets 27; that contradiction is his to resolve and is logged as `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 16.

### 2026-09-11 — Trait content: three packs, and the creature row wins

**Decision:** his ability, disability and immunity dictionaries are extracted into compendium content for the `trait` item type — 1,154 abilities, 249 disabilities and 149 immunities, 1,552 in all, taking the document total from 2,814 to 4,366. Without this the creature actor is unusable in practice: every ability would have to be typed by hand.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *One pack per category, not one pack of traits.* Nineteen names are in two categories at once — Poison, Acid, Aura, Heat, Regeneration, Insanity, Compulsion, Compound Eyes and others are each both an ability and either an immunity or a disability. The importer matches documents by name, so a single pack would silently overwrite one with the other. Three packs (`abilities`, `disabilities`, `immunities`) keep his names intact, which mangling them with a suffix would not.
- *Both of his copies are read, and the creature row wins where they differ.* Each dictionary exists twice, a racial copy for characters and a larger creature copy. 41 shared names carry different rows and 40 entries exist only in the racial copy; the union is built, the creature row is preferred, and every conflict is reported on each run. The creature copy is the larger and more recently extended, and a trait is descriptive here, so what differs is text rather than mechanics. Which copy he considers correct is still his question (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 10).
- *The document name is his lookup key, not the canonical name.* "Acid Regeneration" stays the name and carries `canonicalName: "Regeneration(Acid)"`, because the key is what his data references and the canonical name is what his display code shows.
- *Values stay strings.* `value1` and `value2` mean different things per entry — a damage multiplier in one row, a magic-resistance penalty in another — so typing them as numbers would assert a consistency the data lacks.
- *No sourcebook tag.* These dictionaries carry no book or page, and untagged content is always available at the sourcebook level, which is the right default. Guessing a book would make content vanish when a Game Master switched that book off.

**Known limitation:** an availability override is keyed `type:name`, so `trait:Poison` cannot distinguish the Poison ability from the Poison immunity, and forbidding one forbids both. Nineteen names are affected. Splitting the key by category would need a change to the override format, which is not worth it until someone actually wants to forbid one of those nineteen.

### 2026-09-11 — Item sheets for the creature's own item types

**Decision:** creature attack, power and trait get sheets of their own (`module/sheets/item-sheet.mjs`); the other six item types keep Foundry's default. The attack is the one that forced it — three rider effects of seven fields each is not something anyone can author against a default sheet.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *One base class and three small subclasses, each naming its own body template.* ApplicationV2's `PARTS` is static, so varying the body by document type means either overriding the render-parts machinery or having three subclasses. Three subclasses are duller and obvious to read, which is the right trade for a handoff.
- *The core item sheet is NOT unregistered.* Registration is scoped with `types`, so the six types without a sheet of their own keep working normally. Unregistering the core sheet outright — as the actor side does, where every type is covered — would leave them with nothing.
- *Rider effects are edited as collapsible blocks with Add and Remove*, capped at three because three is what his encoded attack string carries. Adding and removing go through explicit actions that rewrite the array, since a form field cannot grow an array on its own.
- *The effect's display number is computed in `_prepareContext`, not in the template.* Numbering a list in Handlebars needs an arithmetic helper, and whether Foundry's environment provides one is not verifiable here. Computing it where the data is assembled removes the question.
- *Descriptions are a plain textarea.* V14 ships ProseMirror as the only built-in editor, but wiring it needs an API this port cannot exercise, and a textarea round-trips the text correctly in the meantime.

**Not verified:** `foundry.applications.sheets.ItemSheetV2` and `foundry.documents.collections.Items.registerSheet` follow the documented symmetry with the actor equivalents, which the repo's V14 notes cover only for actors. Both are unexercised until someone opens this in a real V14 install. Everything else was checked in `tools/item-preview.html`, which renders all three sheets against the same context the classes build, including a real extracted trait.

### 2026-09-11 — Armour by body type: keyed by area name, not by position

**Decision:** which armour slot covers which body area is now generated from his own `getArmorValuesByBodyTypeAndArmor` into `ARMOR_COVERAGE_BY_BODY_TYPE` and `ARMOR_REQUIRES_ITEM` (`module/combat-tables.mjs`), and read through `getAreaArmorSlot` / `getAreaArmor` in `combat/combat-rules.mjs`. Both actor models use it, replacing the flat humanoid-only table they shared. This closes the gap that left every non-humanoid unprotected by worn armour — which mattered little for characters and a great deal for creatures.

**The one deliberate difference from his code.** His function switches on the area's **position** in the body chart and returns an index into the armour row. He matches the family with `includes()`, so one branch serves every chart containing that word, and the charts do not all order their areas the same way. Two branches have drifted out of step with the charts they serve:
- **Snake** is written for [Head, Upper Length, Lower Length, shoulders, arms…], but `Snake(Arms)` runs [Head, Upper Length, Left Shoulder, …, Lower Length, Tail]. From position 2 everything is displaced: a shoulder takes the Lower Torso value.
- **Centaur** has a Mid Torso case, but the Centaur chart has no Mid Torso, so from position 9 a hand takes the Mid Torso value and the barding-gated quarters land a position early.

Porting that positionally would have faithfully reproduced armour landing on the wrong limb. So the port keys by **area name**, taken from the comment he wrote on each case — his statement of what that position was meant to be. The generator cross-checks every case against every chart the branch serves and reports each disagreement on each run; both are logged as `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` items 17 and 18.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *Generated, not transcribed.* Eight families of nineteen-odd areas each is exactly the kind of table where a hand-copied off-by-one hides for months. Same rule that caught four bad column maps earlier.
- *Unlisted families get nothing.* Twenty-three of the forty-five body types — Bird, Quadruped, Fish, Giant Spider and the rest — have no branch in his code and take no protection from worn armour. That is his behaviour, not a gap in the port, and the earlier comment claiming otherwise has been corrected.
- *The barding gate is data.* A centaur's quarters and legs, and an arachen's abdomen and legs, take armour only from an item whose name contains "Centaur Barding" or "Insectaur Barding". Extracted as `ARMOR_REQUIRES_ITEM` rather than special-cased in code.
- *`ARMOR_COVERAGE_BY_AREA` stays* as the plain humanoid view, since it reads clearly and is the shape most content is authored against; nothing depends on it now.

**Verified:** regenerating the tables changed nothing that already existed — 217 insertions, no deletions — and all four suites still pass unchanged (derivation 91, creature 121, combat 101, availability 39), confirming the humanoid mapping is equivalent to the flat table it replaced.

### 2026-09-11 — The critical fumble table, ported as data rather than prose

**Decision:** `getCriticalFumble` (sheet-worker.js:26460) is ported as `resolveCriticalFumble`, and `resolveFumble`'s critical branch now reads it instead of returning "the Game Master determines the result".

**What his table is:** a melee critical rolls d100 down nine ten-point bands — hitting a solid object, hitting another target in range, or hitting yourself, each at half, full and double damage — then 91-94 trips, 95-98 trips and takes full damage, and 99 and 100 additionally lose the weapon, thrown 1d20 feet in one of eight compass directions. Those last two bands roll a second d100: under 20 the damage lands normally, otherwise it bypasses armour, and the 100 band stuns for 1d3 seconds before the 1d6+1 needed to stand. A missile critical is always the weapon breaking.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *The consequence is returned as data, not only as text.* `target` ("object", "other", "self" or none), `damageMultiplier` (his half, full and double), `bypassesArmor`, `weaponLost` and `weaponBroken` come back alongside the prose. His sheet could only ever print a sentence, because Roll20 had nowhere to put the rest; here the damage a fumble causes can actually be applied. The text is kept and reads as his does, so a Game Master sees the same thing.
- *Dice are passed in*, as everywhere else in the rules module, so the table is testable without randomness. The two attack paths roll them up front.
- *A caller that omits the new dice still gets a sound result* — the table reads as its first band rather than throwing, which matters because the same function serves both attack paths.

**No upstream defects found:** unlike most of what has been ported lately, this function does exactly what it appears to. The only oddity is that his 99 band tests `critRoll<100` after `critRoll<99` has already been taken, so the 99 band is a single value; that is correct, just written oddly.

**Verified:** 147 combat tests pass, 23 of them new, covering every band, both edges at 10/11, the variant split, the direction lookup and the missile case; the other three suites are unchanged.

### 2026-09-11 — The Lore attack chart is class data, generated from his switch

**Decision:** a class now carries `loreAttackTitle`, the title at which it begins reading the Weapon and Missile Lore attack chart, generated from `getLoreAttackChart` (sheet-worker.js:94897) into `src/packs/named/classLoreTitles.json` and thence into the class documents. The character model derives `combat.loreAttackSkill` from it — the standard chart one level up, once the title is reached — and the combat tab shows it under the attack skill.

**Two tables in his data say when a class gets Lore, and they never agree.** A class row's `attackSkillList` ends "Grandmaster(mastered weapons at 9)", and the switch says Warrior reaches the Lore chart at 6. Comparing all 86 classes: 38 carry both numbers, and they disagree in **every single case** — Archer 3 against 12, Cacophonist 9 against 19. So they are not duplicates of one fact. The call site settles which is which: `setAttackChartsChanges` parses `attackSkillList`, maps Grandmaster down to Master for the standard chart because "cannot set Grandmaster for standard Attack Chart", and then calls `getLoreAttackChart` separately for the Lore chart. The switch governs the Lore chart; the parenthetical is about which weapons are mastered. Only the switch is ported here.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *Generated, not transcribed.* Ninety-two cases with per-class thresholds is precisely where a hand-copied off-by-one hides. Same rule as the armour maps and the column maps before them.
- *A class that never reaches the chart records 0*, rather than being left out, so "this class has no Lore chart" is stated rather than inferred from a missing key. That is true of 51 of the 92 cases.
- *39 of the 86 class documents get a non-zero threshold*, not 41. The switch has two more — Monk and Elemental Dancer — that have no class document at all; Monk is the row with the column defect recorded as item 1, which is why it never built.
- *Derived on the character, not stored.* His sheet keeps a second stored chart (`special_attack_skill`) updated at titling; everything it depends on is already derived here, so storing it would only create something to fall out of step.

**Not ported, and now understood well enough to say why:** the six lore *acquisition* tables (`getWeaponLoreWhen` and its missile, projectile, multi-missile, spell and armour siblings, lines 94997-95884) are a different seam — they decide when the skill itself is acquired and grant combat modifiers, not which chart is read. They are also where seventeen of his title gates are written `=>` instead of `>=` and so never gate anything (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 19). Porting them means deciding what the correct gate is, which is his call.

### 2026-09-12 — One name resolver for both armour and shield coverage, and a gap it closed

**What went wrong first.** Keying armour coverage by area name rather than by his positions (the
entry above, "Armour by body type") fixed two families whose positions had drifted. It also
introduced a quieter fault of its own: a body chart does not always spell an area the way the
comment on the case serving it does. His Insectoid charts say `Left Lower Leg` where his case
comment says `Left Shin`, and `Left Mid Claw/Hand` where it says `Left Mid Claw`; his hooved
Humanoid charts say `Left Hoof` where the case says `Left Foot`; `Humanoid(Fish Tail)` says
`Finned Tail` where the case says `Left Thigh`. An exact name lookup finds none of those, so the
area silently took **no worn armour at all** — 22 area instances across eight body charts,
including both an insectoid's mid hands and shins and every hooved character's feet. Here his
position-keyed original was right and the port was wrong, which is the opposite way round from
items 17 and 18.

**Decision:** both tables are now built through one resolver, `chart_area_lookup`, which answers
"what does this chart call the area his case comment names?" in three passes, most trustworthy
first:
1. **exact** — the name appears in the chart, wherever it sits.
2. **normalised** — it appears under different spacing (`Left Foreshin` against `Left Fore Shin`
   on the Centaur chart). Letters and digits only, case folded. Checked across every family and
   chart for collisions before adopting: there are none.
3. **positional** — same position, different words. This is the pass that could hide a
   displacement, so it runs only while chart and branch are still in step and stops for good at
   the first sign they are not. Two conditions end it: his name is already matched elsewhere in
   this chart (so it belongs to that other position — this is what stops `Snake(Arms)`), or the
   chart's own name here is one of his other case labels (so he has a case for it elsewhere —
   this is what stops a plain `Snake`'s Tail being armoured as a shoulder, and Centaur at the Mid
   Torso it does not have).

Every pass-three match is printed on each run, because it is a judgement call rather than a
mechanical one. There are 23, across seven distinct name pairs.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *A merfolk's finned tail does take the thigh slot.* Pass three matches it, which reproduces his
  sheet exactly. It is not the same kind of error as items 17 and 18: a tail is genuinely where
  the legs would be, and nothing lands on an unrelated limb. Already noted for him under item 19.
- *Matching a spelling never invents coverage.* The name is resolved first and the slot looked up
  second, so an area his branch gives no slot still gets none — a Centaur's fore shins resolve by
  spacing and remain unarmoured, as his branch leaves them.
- *The dead keys are gone.* `Mid Torso` under Centaur, and the four Insectoid spellings no chart
  uses, are no longer emitted; the map now contains only names a real chart carries.
- *One resolver, two tables.* The shield table is keyed off the very same position labels —
  his own case comments in `getArmorValuesByBodyTypeAndArmor` — rather than re-deriving his
  assumed chart a second time. One statement of it, used twice.

**Effect:** 106 chart-area instances had no armour slot before; 83 do now, and those 83 are
areas his branches genuinely leave unprotected (tails, wings, pincers, underbellies, and the
shins and feet of the many-legged bodies). 155 combat tests pass, 8 of them new; derivation 99,
creature 121 and availability 39 are unchanged, and all 26 modules parse.

### 2026-09-12 — Shield coverage: his positions are sound except for the same two families

**Decision:** `SHIELD_COVERAGE` is generated from `equipShield` (sheet-worker.js:103777) into
`module/combat-tables.mjs` — family, then shield size, then handedness, giving the list of areas
that shield covers. `unequipShield` needs no table of its own: it simply clears the whole layer.

**The index convention was verified before any of it was written**, because assuming it is what
produced items 17 and 18. His `bodyAreaShieldLayer5[N]` really is the area's 0-based position in
the body chart, the same convention the armour coverage assumes — and it lines up exactly for
Humanoid, Saurian, Insectoid, Arachen, Scethen and Brachara. It does **not** for Snake or
Centaur, where it is displaced by one in precisely the same way, and the same direction, as his
armour branches are. So items 17 and 18 are not confined to `getArmorValuesByBodyTypeAndArmor`:
the same two wrong mental charts were used a second time, in a second function, independently.
His Snake branch is written for a chart running Head, Upper Length, **Lower Length**, then
shoulders; his Centaur branch for one with a **Mid Torso at position 9**. Both are recorded
against the existing items rather than as new ones, since it is the same defect.

**What the table says.** A shield is held in the off hand, so a right-hander is covered down the
left side, and the sizes grow outward from the hand: Buckler the forearm *or* the hand, Small
both, Medium adding the arm, Large the shoulder too, and Body the whole flank down to the foot.
His own Buckler comments name those areas in words ("equip on the right forearm") and agree with
the position labels for every family, which is the cross-check that the decode is right.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *Ambidextrous is right-handed.* His code tests `tempHandedness=="Left"` and takes everything
  else as the other hand, so "Ambidextrous" — a value his racial code really does set
  (sheet-worker.js:49206) — falls into the else branch and wears the shield as a right-hander
  does. Recorded as such rather than invented away.
- *A Buckler is two entries, not a flag.* `Buckler` is held in the hand and `Buckler(Wrist)` is
  strapped to the forearm, which is the choice his `equip_buckler_on_wrist` makes. Two keys read
  better than a flag threaded through the lookup.
- *An Insectoid's Large shield covers no more than its Medium*, because his own comment says so:
  "Insects have no shoulder joints. No changes between medium/large shields."
- *A Snake's Body shield covers its Lower Length and Tail* instead of legs it does not have, and
  a Centaur's reaches the foreleg and fore shin but not the hind. Both are his.
- *An area a chart does not have simply drops out.* A plain `Snake` has four areas and no arms,
  so a shield lands nowhere on it; `Humanoid(Fish Tail)` has no legs, so a Body shield stops at
  the hand and the tail. His code writes past the end of those charts and the writes are
  discarded by his own bounds loop, so this matches.
- *Generated, not transcribed.* Five sizes across five family branches, each mirrored by
  handedness, is 96 lists. Same rule that caught the column maps, the armour maps and the Lore
  chart before it.

### 2026-09-12 — The shield layer on the body, and a double count it removed

**Decision:** `getAreaShield` in `combat/combat-rules.mjs` reads `SHIELD_COVERAGE`, and both actor
models add its result on top of the worn armour at each area. A shield is its own layer, kept
apart from the four armour ones exactly as his sheet keeps `bodyarea*_shield_layer5` apart.

**What it corrected.** A shield's own armour value sits in the **left hand** column of
`armorvalueslist` whichever hand really holds it — his comment at `equipShield` says so outright,
"All shields have at least armor value in area 13 (use this as the basis)". Until now the port
treated an equipped shield as ordinary armour, so that column was read as coverage: every shield
protected the wearer's left hand and nothing else, whatever its size and whichever hand held it.
A left-hander was shielded on the wrong hand, and a Large shield gave nothing to the arm or
shoulder it covers. The models therefore filter shields out of the worn-armour total before
adding the shield layer, or the off hand would be protected twice.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *The shield layer takes no armour damage.* Accumulated damage comes off the worn armour only,
  which is his behaviour: he degrades the four worn layers area by area and clears the shield
  layer wholesale when the shield comes off.
- *Handedness is a field on both actors.* The character already had one, unused and unshown; the
  creature gains one, because his `handedness` attribute is shared by both of his sheets. Blank
  reads as right-handed, which is what his else branch does, and the dropdown says so.
- *The buckler's wrist option sits on the item, not the actor.* His sheet asks once, as
  `equip_buckler_on_wrist`, because only one shield can ever be worn there. A Foundry actor can
  own several bucklers, so the choice belongs to the buckler. Same behaviour, better home.
- *`magicBonus` is a field on armour, not parsed out of a name.* His `getItemPlusInt` reads "+2"
  back out of the item's name; storing it means nothing downstream has to parse a name. On a
  shield his rule is to add the plus and then double the whole value, so a +2 shield of 20 is
  worth 44 — that is his arithmetic as written, and it is reproduced rather than "corrected".
- *Rune modifiers are left unimplemented but not designed out.* His `equipShield` adds
  `Rune Strenghthen` and `Rune Armor` before the doubling. Runes are a deferred subsystem, so
  nothing supplies them; the place they go is where his is.
- *The covered-area list is the family's, not the chart's.* It can name an area a particular
  chart has not got, and can name one area under two spellings, because everything downstream
  asks about areas the chart really has, one at a time. Checked across all 45 charts: no chart
  carries both a spelling and its alias, so nothing is ever counted twice.

**Verified:** 183 combat tests pass, 28 of them new, covering every size, both handednesses,
Ambidextrous and blank, the two drifted families, an area no chart has, the insectoid's equal
medium and large, the magic doubling and the value column. 116 derivation tests (17 new) and 129
creature tests (8 new) cover the assembled body on both actor types, including that the off hand
is shielded once and not twice, that armour damage does not eat the shield, and that a stashed
shield protects nothing. Availability 39 unchanged, 26 modules parse. Both sheets were checked in
`tools/sheet-preview.html` and `tools/creature-preview.html` against a real `Shield(Large/Plate)`
from the armour pack: a right-hander's left shoulder, arm, forearm and hand read 38, being 18
worn plus 20 of shield, and the right side stays at 18.

**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14 — no such install exists on this machine.
That covers the new fields reaching the database, the handedness dropdown actually writing back,
and the sheet re-rendering when a shield is equipped or unequipped.

### 2026-09-12 — Pain threshold is a signed damage modifier, not a threshold

**Decision:** `applyPainThreshold` ports the first thing his `handleBodyDamage` does to a blow
(sheet-worker.js:71186-71193), and `applyAttackDamage` runs every blow through it before armour
sees it. Both actor types carry `combat.painThreshold` and `combat.highPainThreshold`.

**The name is misleading and his own sheet settles it.** "Pain threshold" sounds like a level a
blow has to clear before it hurts. It is not: the value is simply *added* to incoming damage, and
the note he wrote beside the field reads "reduces or adds to all incoming damage (-/+)". So a
**negative** pain threshold is the tougher character and a positive one the more tender. Porting
it as a floor would have inverted it, which is why the sheet markup was checked and not just the
code.

**Where it lands in the pipeline.** First, above everything: before invulnerability, before
spirit, force and outer kinetic armour, before the magic shield and weaves, and before armour
blocking. Those magical pre-reductions are their own backlog items and are not ported here; the
order they go in is now recorded at the call site so they slot in without re-deriving it.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *The result is not floored.* His is not either — the floor sits further down, after the magical
  pre-reductions — so `applyPainThreshold` can return a negative and `resolveAreaDamage` floors
  it, exactly as his does.
- *The Famorian evoke's extra point is a parameter, not a guess.* `highPainThreshold` takes one
  more point off. Nothing sets it yet, because the evoke system is its own backlog item, but the
  field and the argument exist so the arithmetic is complete and wiring it later is one line.
- *One oddity is reproduced rather than filed.* He decides whether any damage was entered from
  the RAW figure, before the threshold, and then skips armour blocking altogether when there was
  none (`noDamageInput`, line 71188, used at 71284). So a blow of nothing against a positive
  threshold gets through unblocked and the armour takes nothing. It is only reachable when a hit
  lands for zero, so it is carried across as `noDamageEntered` and documented at both ends rather
  than raised as a defect.
- *It is an editable stat on the combat tab*, next to the derived ones, because it is the Game
  Master's dial rather than something derived from attributes.

**Verified:** 195 combat tests pass, 12 of them new, covering both signs, the evoke's extra
point, a missing value, the un-floored negative and the floor that catches it, and both sides of
the no-damage-entered branch. Derivation 116, creature 129, availability 39 unchanged; 26 modules
parse. Both sheets were checked in the preview harnesses with a real value set.

**Not verified:** the field writing back from the sheet, and the note reaching the chat card —
both need a running Foundry V14, which this machine does not have.

### 2026-09-12 — Damage absorption is a pool, and a correction to how a blow of nothing behaves

**Decision:** `absorbDamage` ports the last thing his `handleBodyDamage` does to a blow
(sheet-worker.js:71359-71366), and `blowLands` ports the test that decides whether the blow does
anything at all (line 71322). Both actor types carry `combat.damageAbsorb`.

**Absorption is a pool, not a per-blow reduction.** It takes what it can off the damage *after*
armour has blocked its share and after natural hide, and it is spent by the same amount, so it
wears out across a fight. Both figures are worked from the values before either changed and then
floored at zero, which is his arithmetic exactly. A pool of 10 against four blows of 3 stops the
first three and lets 2 through on the fourth.

**Where the pool comes from is deliberately not ported yet.** His `checkSpiritForceArmorModifiers`
(line 106966) refills it, every time equipment changes, to the better of a `Rune Absorption: +N`
on worn armour and the Game Master's own modifier — and it does the same for force armour, outer
kinetic armour and spiritual armour, each taking the *maximum* rather than stacking. Runes are a
deferred subsystem and the magic armours are their own backlog item, so for now the pool is
entered and spent by hand. Worth noting a real tension in his design for when that lands: the
same attribute is both a derived maximum and a depleting pool, so equipping anything refills it.

**CORRECTION to the pain threshold entry above.** That entry said his `noDamageInput` flag
"skips the armour blocking" so that "a blow of nothing against a positive pain threshold gets
through unblocked". That was wrong, and the port built on it was wrong with it. The guard at line
71322 is `if (!isLost && !noDamageInput)`, and it wraps not just the blocking but the armour
damage, the hide reduction, the absorption **and the store of the final damage**. So a hit that
rolled under 1 does nothing whatever — no wounds, no armour damage, no absorption spent —
however large a positive pain threshold the target carries. The mistake was reading the guard's
extent from the line that opens it rather than from the indentation of what it contains.

`resolveAreaDamage` therefore loses the `noDamageEntered` input it was given an hour ago, and the
rule moves to `blowLands`, called before anything else in `applyAttackDamage`. Two tests that
asserted the wrong behaviour are replaced by four that assert the right one.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *`blowLands` also takes an `isLost` argument*, because the same guard covers it: an area marked
  LOST cannot be hurt. Lost limbs are not modelled yet, so nothing passes `true` — the argument
  is there so the rule is stated where it belongs rather than rediscovered later.
- *The pool is written back on the actor*, and only when it actually changed, so applying damage
  spends it. This is the first thing in the port where applying damage changes something other
  than wounds and armour damage.
- *The chat card reports what absorption took and what is left*, because a pool the players
  cannot see is a pool they will forget.

**Verified:** 208 combat tests pass, 13 of them new, covering an empty pool, a pool larger and
smaller than the blow, an exact match, a missing value, four blows wearing one pool down, and the
ordering against hide. Derivation 116, creature 129, availability 39 unchanged; 26 modules parse.
Both sheets were checked in the preview harnesses with a pool set.

**Not verified:** the pool writing back to the database and the chat note — a running Foundry V14,
which this machine does not have.

### 2026-09-12 — Magical protection, and what an endured blow really does

**Decision:** the pre-reduction block of his `handleBodyDamage` (sheet-worker.js:71249-71272) is
ported as `applyMagicalReductions`, with `isEndured`, `isRebounded` and `getWeaveValue` beside
it. Both actor types carry `spiritArmor`, `forceArmor`, `outerKinetic`, `magicShield` and
`invulnerable`. This completes the damage pipeline: pain threshold, magical protection, armour
blocking, armour wear, hide, absorption, wounds.

**Endured and rebounded blows do nothing whatever.** This is the finding that matters most here,
and it is easy to misread as a reduction. His whole normal pipeline sits in
`else if (!reboundOn && !enduredOn)`, and the branch that catches the other case simply clears
every outcome flag. So an endured blow deals no damage, wears no armour and triggers no effect —
total immunity, not a matter of degree. A "Rebound" item does the same for the five physical
damage types and nothing else.

**Invulnerability is the only one that scales.** A weapon with no magical plus does nothing at
all to an invulnerable target, +1 or +2 does a quarter, +3 or +4 a half, and +5 or better lands
in full. Everything else in the block subtracts, and the floor at zero lands once, at the end,
which is why the order is kept rather than tidied into a sum.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *The endured table is generated, not transcribed*, though it is only ten rows. Nine of his ten
  cases accept a blanket `Enduring All` and the tenth, Obliteration, does not — one missing line
  in ten near-identical cases, which is exactly what a hand copy smooths over. Logged for him as
  `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 20, and the table picks the line up if he adds it.
- *A weave is counted as hide and then taken back out of the armour total.* His code does both:
  it subtracts the weave up here, then blocks against `tempAreaTotalArmor - weaveValue`. Getting
  only half of that right would have counted magical clothing twice, so the port returns the
  weave it used and the caller removes it from the armour it passes on.
- *A weave is magical CLOTHING so tagged* — all three conditions, matching his test. Armour
  tagged `[Magical Weave]` is worth nothing, and so is unenchanted clothing.
- *The values are entered by hand for now.* His `checkSpiritForceArmorModifiers` sets each to the
  BEST of what worn magic items grant and the Game Master's modifier — the maximum, not a sum —
  reading `[Base Aura:xx]` off a Force Armor item, base Piety off a Spiritual Armor one, base
  aura divided by five off a Kinetic Barrier(Outer), and `Rune Force Armor: +N`. Every one of
  those names belongs to a deferred magic subsystem, so the automatic sources land with those
  subsystems and the fields are the manual path until then. The rule that they take a maximum
  rather than stacking is recorded at the schema so it is not re-derived.
- *Invulnerability reads the weapon's plus from the attack card*, which both the weapon and the
  creature card already record as `damage.magic`.

**Verified:** 240 combat tests pass, 32 of them new, covering each protection alone and stacked,
the floor landing once, the magic shield's bypass exception, all five invulnerability bands, the
nine types `Enduring All` covers and the one it does not, rebound on the physical types only, and
the weave's doubling and its removal from the armour total. Derivation 116, creature 129,
availability 39 unchanged; 26 modules parse. Both sheets checked in the preview harnesses.

**Not verified:** the fields writing back and the chat notes — a running Foundry V14, which this
machine does not have.

### 2026-09-12 — Per-weapon lore, and why it was not blocked after all

**Decision:** Weapon Lore and Missile Lore are ported — the class titles at which they are
acquired, the two per-weapon lists, and what they are worth to an attack. A class carries
`weaponLoreTitle` and `missileLoreTitle`, generated from `getWeaponLoreWhen` and
`getMissileLoreWhen`; the character derives `combat.hasWeaponLore` / `hasMissileLore`, and stores
one comma-separated list of specifically lored weapons for each.

**These were on the blocked list and should not have been.** `PROGRESS.md` had the six lore
acquisition tables blocked behind `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 19, on the grounds that porting them
means deciding what the broken `=>` gates should have been. Reading the usage properly shows that
is true of only some of them. For Weapon Lore and Missile Lore his code states the rule correctly
in one place — `if ((currentTitle+1)>whenWeaponLoreAcquired)` at line 82558, which for whole
titles is exactly `title >= when` — even though three or four other gates on the same two lores
are written `currentTitle=>whenAcquired` and never gate anything. Where his own code contradicts
itself, the half written correctly states the intent, so no guess was needed. The two lookup
functions themselves are clean; the defect is entirely in the callers. Item 19 now carries a
table of which of the six have a correct gate and which do not — Second Weapon Knowledge and
Multiple Missile Lore have none, and remain genuinely his call.

**What lore is worth**, from the modifier list his sheet builds (lines 82559-82605):

| | attack | damage | speed | skills |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| the general kind | +2 | +4 | -1 | +10% |
| a specifically lored weapon | +3 | +6 | -2 | +20% |

**The specific figures replace the general ones; they do not add to them.** A lored weapon is +3
to hit, not +2 and +3 again. His own comment in `getWeaponSpeedListingAdjustmentForModifier`
settles it — "only give a -1 more, -1 is already accounted for in the general mod" — which makes
a lored weapon -2 in total, and the same reading applies to the rest of the row.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *The lists are stored as he stores them*, one comma-separated string each, and parsed once into
  `weaponLoreNames` / `missileLoreNames`. An array field was tried first and reverted: a text
  field on the sheet cannot write one back, and a string is his shape anyway.
- *Names are matched simplified.* His lists hold the base name, and `getSimplifiedName` strips a
  customised item's `{Base Name}` wrapper, so "Fine {Bastard Sword} of Ice" is lored if "Bastard
  Sword" is listed. Ported as its own function rather than inlined, since other lore types will
  want it.
- *Melee reads Weapon Lore and missile reads Missile Lore, and neither touches the other.* A
  weapon with both kinds of mode gets whichever applies to the mode actually swung.
- *The weapons table marks a lored weapon*, capitalised for a specific lore and lower case for
  the general kind, with the four figures on the tooltip. The panel that edits the lists appears
  only when the character actually has the lore, since the lists mean nothing otherwise.
- *The Lore panel's context is built in the sheet class, not the template*, because joining a list
  and testing two flags at once both need Handlebars helpers whose presence in Foundry's
  environment this port cannot check. Same reasoning as the item sheets' effect numbering.

**Verified:** 270 combat tests pass, 30 of them new, covering the two figure sets, the acquisition
rule at and either side of the title, a class that never acquires it, simplified-name matching,
list parsing, all three melee modes, the missile/melee separation, that specific replaces general,
and that lore reaches the to-hit sum as its own line. 123 derivation tests, 7 new, cover the class
and title deriving the flags and the stored list being parsed. Creature 129 and availability 39
unchanged; 26 modules parse. The sheet was checked in the preview: a Warrior at title 12 holds
both lores, the Bastard Sword is marked specifically and the Dagger generally, and their speeds
differ by the one point that distinguishes them.

**Not verified:** the lists writing back from the sheet and the lore line reaching the chat card —
a running Foundry V14, which this machine does not have.

### 2026-09-12 — CORRECTION: what per-weapon lore actually does in his sheet, and two claims that were wrong

A planning pass over the remaining lore types checked the previous entry's claims against the
source. Two were wrong and one was right for the wrong reason.

**Wrong: "Second Weapon Knowledge and Multiple Missile Lore have no correctly written gate."**
All six lore types have one, and all six sit in `setGeneralCombatModifierDisplay` (line 82451) in
the form `(currentTitle+1)>whenAcquired`. Not one of item 19's seventeen broken gates is inside
that function. So **none of the six is blocked** on deciding what the gate should have been — his
own code states the rule for every one of them. The table in item 19 has been replaced.

**Wrong: the per-weapon lore bonus is applied.** It is not. The numeric path,
`setCombatModifierValues` (82167), only ever assigns the **general** figures — 2 melee, 4 damage,
10% skills — and never reads the lore list at all. The larger per-weapon tier (3 / 6 / 20%) exists
only in the display string. In his live sheet, naming a weapon in a lore list changes nothing but
what the modifier panel prints. Logged as `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 21.

**Right, but for the wrong reason: the -1 / -2 weapon speed.** The previous entry justified those
from his comment "only give a -1 more, -1 is already accounted for in the general mod". That
comment is stale. The general -1 was deliberately removed, and his reason is at line 82273 — a
character-wide speed modifier cannot tell a melee weapon from a missile one — so his sheet gives 0
general and -1 specific where the panel promises -1 and -2.

**Decision: the port keeps both tiers, and keeps -1 / -2.** It implements what his panel promises
rather than what his numeric path delivers, on the standing policy that where his code defeats its
own evident intent the intent is implemented and the defect recorded. Three things make that the
right call here rather than an invention: the panel is what a player reads and plays by; a
per-weapon lore list is inert under his numeric behaviour, which cannot be the design; and the
melee-versus-missile problem that forced him to drop the general speed modifier does not arise in
this port, which works lore out per weapon and per attack mode. It is a real departure from his
running behaviour and is flagged as such in item 21, with the question put back to him.

**Process note:** this was found by a planning pass for the *next* task, not by the work itself.
The previous entry was written from the display function and the speed function without checking
whether the numbers reached a numeric field — the same class of mistake as reading a guard's
extent from the line that opens it. Worth remembering that "his code says X" needs to name which
of his code paths, given how often the display and the arithmetic disagree in this sheet.

### 2026-09-12 — Projectile Lore, per die, and a second correction to item 21

**Decision:** Projectile Lore is ported. A class carries `projectileLoreTitle` (six of the 92 ever
acquire it, all archer classes); the character derives `hasProjectileLore` and keeps a list of
specifically lored projectiles; `getProjectileLoreDamage` gives the damage.

**It is the odd one of the lore family, in two ways.** It is worth damage **per die** rather than
a flat figure — `getNumberOfDice(damage) × 1`, or `× 2` for a listed projectile
(sheet-worker.js:64990) — so a weapon with flat damage gets nothing from it at all. And it attaches
to the **ammunition**, not the weapon in hand: a bow is lored through the arrow it normally fires,
so `getProjectileForLauncher` resolves the launcher first and the lore list is checked against the
arrow's name. Loring the bow's own name does nothing, which the tests pin down.

**The three name chains are generated, and order is load-bearing.** `isWeaponProjectile`,
`isWeaponLauncher` and `getNormalProjectileFromLauncher` are ordered `includes()` chains — 16, 49
and 49 tests. "Bolted" is tested before "Bolt" so a bolted-leather shield does not read as a
crossbow bolt, and several pairs work that way. They are emitted as ordered arrays and read by
taking the first substring the name contains; turning them into objects or sets would have lost
the ordering and hidden the bug.

**CORRECTION to item 21, the second in two passes.** The previous entry said the per-weapon lore
tier "is never applied numerically" and that it "exists only in the display string". That was read
from `setCombatModifierValues` alone and is wrong. `handlePhysicalAttacks` does apply the specific
tier, and does it by exactly the arithmetic this port uses: it subtracts the general modifier and
applies the specific one (`modMeleeOther-2` then `modWL=3`; `modDamOther-4` then `WLDamMod=6`).
So the design decision that the specific figure *replaces* the general one, previously justified
only from a comment, is now confirmed by his code.

The real defect is narrower: **`MLDamMod` is missing from the damage sum.** Missile Lore's
specific damage is computed, tested and printed in the listing, and left out of the line that
rolls the damage, where `WLDamMod` sits beside it. So a lored bow is told it does +6 and does not.
Item 21 is rewritten around that.

**The lesson, twice now:** "his code does X" needs to name which of his paths. This sheet keeps a
stored-modifier path, an attack path and a display path, and all three disagree about lore. The
previous entry's process note said as much and the entry still got it wrong by checking two paths
out of three. Checking the attack path first is the rule going forward, since that is where play
actually happens.

**Verified:** 291 combat tests pass, 21 of them new, covering the dice count, the ordered name
chains including the Bolted/Bolt pair, general and specific per-die damage, a melee weapon getting
nothing, flat-damage ammunition getting nothing, and a launcher being lored through its arrow
rather than its own name. Derivation 123, creature 129, availability 39 unchanged; 26 modules
parse.

**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14. The sheet panel gained a Projectile row
but was not checked in the preview this pass — the preview character is a Warrior, which never
acquires Projectile Lore, so exercising it needs a fixture change. Left for Sonnet.

### 2026-09-12 — Hand-authored classes from his Word templates, and the Elemental Dancer

**Decision:** classes his sheet-worker cannot describe are authored in `src/packs/manual/classes.json`
from his own Word class templates, and merged by `build_documents.py` after the generated ones.
The Elemental Dancer is the first, built from "2c, Elemental Dancer.doc" supplied by the user.

**Why a manual layer is needed at all.** `classtitledict` and `goalupdict` hold 92 classes;
`classRequirementsAndDetails` holds 88. Five classes — Elemental Dancer, Elementalist, GME,
Inquisitor, Summoner — exist in the first two and in no row of the third, so the document builder,
which keys off the requirements dictionary, silently produced nothing for them. That is why the
class count has been 86 all along while his switches carry 92 cases. Logged as
`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 22.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *His sheet-worker still wins where it has a value.* The titles come from `classtitledict`, the
  goal attributes from `goalupdict`, and the four lore titles from his switches. The Word template
  fills only what his code does not carry. Every disagreement is recorded in the entry's own
  `_notes` as well as in item 22.
- *A manual entry never overwrites a generated one.* If he adds the missing rows, the generated
  class wins and the manual entry is reported as `manual-class-redundant` on the next build. That
  keeps this from becoming a fork of his data.
- *Provenance travels with the entry.* Each carries `_document` naming the file it came from and
  `_fromSheetWorker` listing which fields came from his code instead. Keys beginning with `_` are
  stripped when the document is built, so none of it reaches Foundry.
- *`advancement.classSkills` is a new field*, parallel to `titles`, holding the skills gained at
  each title. His `classtitledict` carries only the title NAMES, so this is empty for all 86
  generated classes and filled only from the Word templates. Without it the most substantial part
  of the template — a fifteen-row skill progression — would have been dropped on the floor.
- *Angle-bracketed skills are kept verbatim.* "<1st Kinesis>", "<Lore Type>", "<Call of Element>"
  and "<2nd Kinesis>" are placeholders his template resolves from a per-element table, and that
  table is preserved in the description. Resolving them into six element-specific variants would
  have invented six classes he did not write.
- *The Dancer Extension table is preserved as prose only.* Core-skill thresholds and
  racial-maximum attribute requirements have no home in the class schema, and inventing an
  extension model for one class would be the wrong order to do that work in.

**The two disagreements**, both resolved his code's way: `goalupdict` says the goal attributes are
Strength and Agility while the template's Goal Advancement line says Strength and **Will Force**;
and `classtitledict`'s fifteenth title is "One with the Element" where the template writes "One
with `<Element>`". The first is a real rules difference and is the one put back to him.

**A cross-check worth recording because it held:** the template lists Weapon Lore as a title 8
class skill, and `getWeaponLoreWhen` independently returns 8. Two sources written years apart
agreeing is good evidence the generated lore tables are being read correctly.

**Verified:** 87 class documents now build, up from 86, and the total is 4,367. 300 combat tests
pass, 9 of them new, covering the new class's attack progression at every step and the
title-8 Weapon Lore boundary. Derivation 123, creature 129, availability 39 unchanged; 26 modules
parse. Monk remains unbuilt for a different reason — item 1's column defect — and is not addressed
here.

### 2026-09-12 — Off-hand fighting: audit before schema design (no code written)

A research pass over the two-weapon subsystem, so the eventual build starts from fact. Nothing is
implemented. Following the rule adopted after item 21, the **attack path was read first**.

**The consumption model is small and clear.** `handlePhysicalAttacks` picks one of three tiers per
weapon, from three per-weapon flags (`weaponN_offhand`, `weaponN_2weapknow`, `weaponN_2weaplore`):

```js
if (weaponN_offhand=="on") {
    if (weaponN_2weaplore=="on")       { offHandPenalty=0; offHandDamMod=0; }          // Lore: no penalty at all
    else if (weaponN_2weapknow=="on")  { offHandPenalty=offhand_2nd_weapon_tohit; ... } // Knowledge: reduced
    else                               { offHandPenalty=combat_mod_tohit_offhand; ... } // neither: full
}
```

So Second Weapon **Lore** in a weapon removes the off-hand penalty entirely, **Knowledge** buys it
down, and without either the wielder takes the full base penalty. The tiers are per weapon, not
per character.

**The base penalty is three Agility-banded tables** — `getOffhandMeleeAdj`, `getOffhandDamageAdj`
and `getOffhandSkillAdj` (sheet-worker.js:83305-83370). All three return 0 for an **Ambidextrous**
character, which is the whole mechanical payoff of that racial ability. **The three do not share
band edges** — the melee penalty reaches 0 at Agility 19, the damage and skill penalties at 20, and
the damage table singles out 16 and 17 individually where the others do not. That is precisely the
shape that a hand transcription smooths over, so they are to be generated.

**Buying the penalty down.** Second Weapon Knowledge gives `skillChance / 20` levels, each worth
one point of to-hit and damage back and 5% of skills, never past zero (line 83188). Second Weapon
Lore gives `skillChance / 20` levels capped at 5, each worth one **extra off-hand second** — and
zero if Ambidextrous, who need no extra time (line 83242). So both read the character's own skill
percentage, which means this subsystem depends on skills resolving to a number on the actor.

**Neither is blocked.** Both gates in those two functions are the broken `=>` form, but both have a
correctly written twin in `setGeneralCombatModifierDisplay` (82620 and 82657), so the intended rule
is `title >= when` as with the other lores. See the corrected table in `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 19.

**What the port already has:** handedness on both actor types (added for shields), Agility and its
modifiers, the ten-second round tracker, and skills as items with computed chances.

**What it does not have, and what needs deciding before code:**
1. **What an "extra off-hand second" means in Foundry.** His sheet stores a number and leaves the
   rest to the table. It could be a discount on the off-hand attack's cost, or extra seconds of
   action in the round. The tracker spends seconds per action, so either is expressible; they play
   very differently and this is the one real design question.
2. **Three new booleans on the weapon item** — off-hand, second-weapon-knowledge,
   second-weapon-lore — mirroring his per-weapon flags.
3. **Whether declaring an off-hand attack is a weapon property or an attack option.** His model is
   a stored per-weapon flag; an attack-time choice would suit Foundry better but departs from him.

**Estimate:** comparable to the shield and per-weapon-lore passes combined. Two natural halves:
the base penalty (tables, handedness, the weapon flags, the full-penalty tier) and then the two
skills that buy it down. Splitting them keeps each commit testable.

#### RESOLVED 2026-09-12 — the three questions above, answered by the user

**1. What an "extra off-hand second" means: a discount on the off-hand attack's cost.**
The user's framing is sharper than the question was: *ambidexterity functionally overrides two-weapon
fighting, because an ambidextrous character does not lose time fighting with the off hand.* So the
direction is settled — **fighting off-handed COSTS seconds**, and that cost is what the subsystem is
about. Second Weapon Lore's up-to-five levels each buy one of those seconds back; an Ambidextrous
character never pays the cost, which is why his code grants them zero levels. That is a non-need, not
a penalty. It is **not** extra general action time in the round: the seconds attach to the off-hand
attack specifically, so they cannot be spent on anything else.

**2. Off-hand is DERIVED, not stored — and this is simpler than his model.**
The user's answer replaces the question rather than picking from it: *a weapon is tagged on the combat
page as **left, right or both***. That is a three-state hand assignment, not the boolean
`weaponN_offhand` his sheet carries. Combined with `handedness`, which **both actor types already
have** (added in the shield pass, where a right-hander is covered down the left side), off-handedness
falls out of the data:

> a weapon is off-hand when its hand is not the wielder's dominant hand; an Ambidextrous wielder has
> no off hand, so the penalty tier never applies.

This removes a stored flag rather than adding one, keeps a longsword from needing re-editing when it
changes hands, and **reuses a field already built and tested** rather than introducing a parallel one.
"Both" is the two-handed case, which already means something to the damage rule (a Strength bonus is
doubled two-handed), so the tag has to feed that path too rather than being read only by the off-hand
code.

Second Weapon **Knowledge** and **Lore** stay per-weapon properties, as his sheet has them and as the
five already-ported lore types are — only the hand assignment moved.

**3. Model: Opus**, per the project's model-choice protocol.

**What this changes about the estimate.** Item 3 of the Sonnet note ("three booleans on the weapon
item") is now wrong and must not be built as written — it is **one three-state hand field plus two
lore booleans**, and the off-hand boolean is deleted from the plan entirely. The note is corrected
where it sits.

### 2026-09-12 — Three of the six remaining item sheets, not six

The board carried "Item sheets — three of nine done", which reads as six outstanding and a job
two-thirds finished. Reviewed properly, **three of the six should be built and three should stay on
Foundry's default sheet** until something actually authors against them.

**Field count is the wrong ranking.** Race has the most fields of the six (36) and the least demand
for a sheet; equipment has the fewest (9) and needs one least of all. What decides it is whether the
type carries **nested or variable-length structure**, because that is what the default sheet renders
as an unusable dump — the same reason the creature attack got a sheet and the power and trait got
simpler ones.

**Build these three:**

1. **Class — the strongest case, and it is not about fields.** There is a live authoring workflow:
   the Elemental Dancer was hand-authored from his Word class template into
   `src/packs/manual/classes.json` (80 lines for one class), and **four more classes are known to
   need the same treatment** — Elementalist, GME, Inquisitor and Summoner, which appear in his
   `classtitledict` and `goalupdict` but have no `classRequirementsAndDetails` row at all
   (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 22). That work is currently done by hand-editing raw JSON. It is the
   only one of the six with a known, recurring, already-happening authoring need. It also carries
   three `ArrayField`s — `advancement.titles`, `advancement.classSkills`, `classMods` — and
   variable-length arrays are exactly what the default sheet handles worst.
2. **Armour — the structural case.** `coverage` is a `SchemaField` of **19 body locations**, each a
   plain number, which the default sheet renders as nineteen stacked inputs named
   `system.coverage.shoulderLeft` and so on. It wants a body-shaped grid, laid out in the charts'
   own order rather than alphabetically. Homebrew magic armour is common in play, and `magicBonus`
   became a real field in the shield pass.
3. **Race — two 12-wide grids.** `attributeMods` and `attributeLimits` are twelve numbers each and
   must be laid out in his canonical attribute order (str agl vit int wis knw app chm soc aur pty
   wil), not alphabetically, or the sheet stops matching every other attribute display in the
   system.

**Leave these three on the default sheet:** weapon, skill and equipment. They are broad but flat —
equipment is nine plain fields — and Foundry's default sheet renders flat fields acceptably. Building
sheets for them now would be three sheets of busywork against content that is read far more often
than it is written. **The trigger to revisit is authoring, not field count:** if hand-authored
weapons start landing in `src/packs/manual/` the way classes have, the weapon sheet earns its place
that day.

**Why this is recorded rather than just done:** "nine item types, three done" invites a future pass to
finish the set for symmetry. The set should not be finished for symmetry. Six sheets was never the
goal; sheets for the things people author was.

### 2026-09-12 — The character sheet cannot show 19 fields the model carries, and languages are unwired end to end

The board's remaining-tabs row read "combat, magic, journal — combat needs the event-time round
implemented". Checked against the code, **two of those three are wrong**: the combat tab is built
(`templates/actor/tab-combat.hbs`, a PART on the sheet since phase 1) and the event-time round is
implemented (the ascending-initiative tracker in `module/combat/combat-document.mjs`). Magic is
correctly deferred to Layer 4. "Journal" was never the right name for what is actually missing.

**What is actually missing is coverage.** The character sheet has four tabs — attributes, skills,
combat, equipment — and the model carries whole groups none of them render:

| Group | Fields | Reachable on the sheet? |
|---|---|---|
| `physical` | 12 | **1 of 12** — only `handedness`, and only because the shield pass needed it |
| `wealth` | 7 | none |
| `languages` | array of `{name, speak, write}` | none |
| `identity.tendencies` | 1 | none |

So **19 scalar fields and one variable-length array** are in the schema, validated, saved to the
database, and impossible for a player to see or edit. A character cannot record their height, eye
colour, age, money or languages. This is a defect rather than a backlog item, and it is the last gap
in character-sheet coverage.

**Languages are worse than unreachable — they are unwired end to end.** `module/config-tables.mjs`
already carries `spokenLanguages` and `writtenLanguages` as the first two columns of the Intelligence
table, extracted from his data. **Nothing reads either column.** The table is sitting there unused.

**What the fractional values mean, settled from his code rather than guessed.** The progression is
0 through rating 3, then 0.25, 0.33, 0.33, 0.66, then 1 from rating 9, rising to a plateau of 10.
A quarter of a language invites a guess; his code makes it unnecessary. `lang_sheet` is switched
between hardcoded named blocks (49257-49560): `lang_quarter_spoken`, `lang_third_spoken`,
`lang_two_third_spoken`, `lang_one_spoken`, then `lang_one_spoken_third_written`,
`lang_one_spoken_two_third_written`, `lang_one_spoken_one_written`, `lang_two_spoken_one_written`,
and on up.

Read off that ladder the rule is unambiguous:

> Below 1, the figure is **partial fluency in the character's native tongue**, not a fraction of a
> second language — a very low-Intelligence character does not speak even their own language fully.
> At 1 and above it becomes a **count** of languages. Writing always lags speaking: a character has
> one spoken and a third written before they have one of each.

**This is the skills inflation pattern again**, exactly as `DATA-MODEL.md` §1 describes it — Roll20
cannot render a variable count, so he hardcoded one block per combination and reveals the matching
one. It does not port. In Foundry it is the `languages` array plus a derived
`(spokenAllowance, writtenAllowance)` pair off the Intelligence table, with a sub-1 allowance
displayed as partial fluency.

**Scope call:** the tab is mechanical and goes to Sonnet. **Wiring the cap is not part of it** — it
belongs to the Attributes module (Epic 2, Backlog), which is where every other Intelligence-derived
value will land, and putting it on the tab instead would scatter the derivation. The tab renders the
allowance if it exists and simply omits it until then.

### 2026-09-12 — Off-hand fighting, first half: the hand field, the three tables, the full penalty

The base penalty is built — the first of the two halves the audit pass proposed. The second, the two
skills that buy the penalty down, is not started.

**One three-state field replaced two contradictory booleans.** The weapon item carried `twoHanded`
and `offhand`, both under "carried state", and **neither was ever populated from his data** — they
appear nowhere in `build_documents.py` and nowhere in the 594 built weapon documents. They were
wielding state all along, and two booleans can say something a hand cannot do: held in both hands
*and* in the off hand. `hand: "right" | "left" | "both"` cannot express the contradiction. The
Strength damage rule now reads `hand == "both"` where it read `twoHanded`, which is the same fact
from one source instead of two. `offhand` turned out to be dead — declared, never read anywhere.

**Off-handedness is derived, never stored:** a weapon is off-hand when its hand disagrees with the
actor's `handedness`, which the shield pass had already added and tested. An **Ambidextrous** wielder
has no off hand at all, because all three of his penalty functions short-circuit on handedness before
they look at Agility (83307, 83331, 83351). That matches the user's framing exactly — ambidexterity
is the absence of the cost, not a bonus on top of it.

Note a deliberate asymmetry that is *his*, not ours: `getShieldAreas` lets "Ambidextrous" fall
through its else branch and read as right-handed, while the penalty tables short-circuit it to zero.
Both behaviours are preserved and the asymmetry is commented at both sites so neither looks like a
slip.

**The three tables are generated, and they do not agree.** `banded_chain()` in
`extract_combat_tables.py` reads a banded `if/else if` chain into ordered `[min, max, value]` rows,
and all three off-hand tables are emitted as `OFFHAND_PENALTIES`. The generator checks band
contiguity over 1..30 and reports gaps rather than leaving holes; all three came back clean. **Melee
reaches zero at Agility 19, damage and skills at 20, and only the damage table breaks out 16 and 17
as single values** — exactly the divergence a hand transcription smooths away, which is why the audit
insisted on generating them. Agility 19 is the test that proves it: melee 0, damage -1, skill -5.
Rows outside every band return zero, which covers both his `<=0` branch and the open top of each
chain without special-casing either.

**The finding worth carrying forward: his function name lies.** `getOffhandMeleeAdj` reads as
melee-only and is not. His `offHandPenalty` appears in **both** `totalmods` branches — the missile one
at sheet-worker.js:64804 and the melee one at 64806 — so a bow drawn in the wrong hand is penalised
exactly as a sword swung in it is. Gating this on melee, which the name invites, would have quietly
made every off-handed archer better than he intended. This is a porting trap rather than a defect in
his code, so it is recorded here and at the call site rather than in `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md`.

**Deliberately left stubbed.** The "knowledge" tier resolves and is reported, but does not yet buy
anything down: Second Weapon Knowledge gives `skillChance / 20` levels (83188), which needs skills
resolving to a number on the actor. Until that lands, a weapon with Knowledge and no Lore pays the
full penalty — which is his own behaviour for a character whose skill has not yet reached one level,
so the stub is correct rather than merely incomplete. The tier is still reported so the seam is
visible in the returned object.

**The tag is on the combat page, as three buttons rather than a dropdown.** The user asked for the
selection to live there, so it does — a Hand column on the weapon table with L / R / 2H, and a
derived "off" marker beside a weapon that is in the wrong hand for this character. Buttons because an
ApplicationV2 `data-action` is dispatched from a **click**: a `<select>` would need its own change
binding, which cannot be verified without a running V14, while buttons take the identical path
`rollWeaponAttack` already uses.

**A gap in the preview harness was found and closed on the way.** `tools/sheet-preview.html`
duplicates the sheet's weapon-row builder rather than calling it, because
`ImagineCharacterSheet.#buildWeaponRows` is private. So the new fields rendered blank there while
being perfectly correct in the sheet — the harness had silently stopped exercising what it appears
to. Both new fields were added to the duplicate and a comment now says it must be kept in step. The
preview's dagger is tagged to the left hand so the off-hand path is actually exercised rather than
merely available.

**Tested:** 330 combat tests pass, **39 of them new** across the hand field, the derivation, the three
tables' differing edges, the tier precedence and the missile path. Derivation 123, creature 129 and
availability 39 are unchanged; 26 modules parse with no syntax errors. The combat tab was checked in
the preview against a real derived character: the sword reads right-handed and clean, the dagger
left-handed and marked off-hand, and the active-hand styling resolves.

**Not verified:** everything needing a running Foundry V14 — that clicking a hand button actually
writes back to the embedded item and re-renders, and that the modifier reaches the chat card. No V14
install exists on this machine.

### 2026-09-12 — A race's movement figures are modifiers on an Agility base (CORRECTS the entry below)

**The entry that follows this one is wrong on its central claim, and is kept only so the mistake is
legible.** It says fourteen races "genuinely have no usable movement in his data" and blames the
preview sheet's zeros on him. Both halves of that are false. This entry replaces it.

**What is actually true.** His race movement columns are **modifiers on a base drawn from Agility**,
not finished rates. `calcMovement` (`sheet-worker.js:30856`) switches on Agility and adds:

```js
setAttrs({move_walk_hourly: 2+racetmpwalkhourly+tmpwalktemphourlymod});
//                          ^ base for this Agility
//                            ^ the race's modifier
```

A race carrying `0/0/0` — Human(Civilized) among them — therefore has **no modifier** and moves at
the full base for its Agility. The port was copying the modifier straight through as the finished
rate, so every such race rendered as unable to move. **The bug was ours from the start.**

**How it was caught.** The user asked whether the rulebooks could supply the missing figures. Reading
the Player's Guide p.36 turned up not a list of per-race rates but *two* tables — "Base Walking /
Jogging / Running Distance" by Agility, and a separate "Racial Movement Modifiers" — and his
Human(Barbaric) row is that second table's `+1/+10/+1`, `+2/+20/+2`, `+2/+30/+3` exactly. Nine out
of nine. That reframed the zeros before a line of code was written.

**The standing conflict rule did not have to be invoked**, which is worth noting: the book and the
sheet agree completely here. All 42 base values the Player's Guide prints match his switch to the
digit, including the irregular jog at Agility 5 — 2 miles but only 10 feet and 1 foot.

**Decision: generate the base table, do not transcribe it.** 23 bands × 11 values is exactly the
volume where hand-copying smooths away the irregularities that matter, which is the same reasoning
that produced the off-hand penalty tables. `movement_bases()` in `extract_combat_tables.py` parses
it out of `calcMovement`. His code contains **two** copies of the table — one for races with a speed
multiplier and one without — and the extractor parses both and compares them; they agree exactly,
which is a stronger check on the parse than any assertion written by hand.

**Decision: a speed multiplier of 0 means ×1.** His own comment in `calcSpecialMovement` says so:
*"most races are 0 (this makes the multiplier 1"*. 103 of 105 races carry 0. Treating it as a literal
zero would have stopped every one of them dead — the same class of error as the one being corrected.

**Decision: apply the book's floor for negative rates, which his sheet does not implement.** The
Player's Guide (p.36) reduces a negative rate to 1 mile / 10 feet / 1 foot. Elf(Sea) and Elf(Ice)
carry a `-10` speed multiplier that his code multiplies through unguarded, giving them roughly -50
miles an hour. The floor is applied here and the `-10` is logged for him as `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md`
item 24. Only a *negative* rate is lifted; a rate that lands on zero honestly stays zero, which is
what his sheet shows at Agility 0-1.

**What this cost.** An upstream issue was filed against his data, with a table of fourteen races and
a note that the Civilized Humans were "likely the most-played races in the game". It was wrong, and
it asked him to fix something that was never broken. It has been withdrawn in place rather than
deleted. The failure was reading a zero as an absence without first checking what his code does with
it — the data was examined closely and the code that consumes it was not.

### 2026-09-13 — The five kinds of special movement do not share a formula

Finishing the other half of the movement work. `movement.special` now resolves, so a Centaur's
Gallop is a distance rather than a blank row. All 26 races that have a special rate produce one, and
none of them lands on zero.

**The formula is per-kind, not universal.** The handoff note had said `base × multiplier + mod` for
all of them, which would have been wrong for four of the five:

| Kind | Shape | |
|---|---|---|
| Fly, Gallop, Swim | `(base × M) × S` | |
| Scurry | `((base × M) + mod) × S` | **the only kind that uses the additive** |
| Slither | `base × M` | no additive, and **no speed multiplier** |

Slither also **replaces** ordinary movement rather than adding to it — his code zeroes walk, jog, run
and both jumps after resolving it: *"Slither is the only movement sssssnake people have"*, *"Snakes
can`t jump"*. That is why it is a table of shapes in `combat-rules.mjs` rather than one expression.

**A third base-rate name exists: `INT`.** Magical flight reads the Intelligence attribute rather than
any movement rate. The earlier handoff note had explicitly said to stop and report if a third name
appeared rather than mapping it by guess; it appeared, in two races.

**Decision: depart from his live code for magical flight, and say so loudly.** His INT line applies a
literal 30 / 30 / 3 on top of the race's own multiplier. Three independent things say that is a slip:
the two Mephyt races carry per-scale multipliers of 0.75 / 30 / 3 where every other race's are
uniform, and those are already a coherent set on their own; his extra literals would make the
ten-second rate a hundred times the one-second rate, which nothing else in the system does; and the
version commented out directly above that line is the multiplier alone. Logged as
`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 25 for him to settle — it is one line either way.

**This is a case the standing conflict rule does not cover.** "The sheet wins" settles
sheet-versus-rulebook. Here his code disagrees with his own data and his own commented-out line, and
there is no rulebook in it at all. Recorded because the next intra-sheet contradiction will want the
same treatment: follow the reading that the data supports, implement it in one place, and hand him
the evidence rather than the conclusion.

**The negative floor had to be extended.** Applying it to walk, jog and run was not enough — Elf(Sea)
is a Swim race, so its -10 speed multiplier dragged the swim rate to -150 miles an hour. Caught by
running the resolver over all 105 real races rather than by the unit tests, which used synthetic
fixtures and all passed. Worth remembering: the fixtures agreed with each other and with me.

**Then the floor turned out to be the wrong instrument for it.** The user pushed back on the result,
and they were right to: flooring left a **sea** elf swimming at 1 mile an hour, slower than it walks.
A number that is no longer absurd is not the same as a number that is right, and the floor had made
the first look like the second.

Looking again at the column rather than the symptom settled it. `speedMultiplier` is `-10` for
exactly two races and `0` for the other 103, and those same two are the only Elves of eleven with **no
disease-resistance modifier** — a value sitting in a column nobody uses, beside an empty cell every
sibling race fills. **Decision: ignore a negative speed multiplier rather than floor it.** The ground
is narrow and does not depend on the mis-keying being true: a multiplier scales a rate, it does not
reverse its direction, so a negative one is not a quantity this system has a meaning for. Sea and Ice
Elves now move like any other Elf, and a Sea Elf swims walk × 3 exactly as Merfolk does.

The floor stays, because it is a real published rule and is honestly reachable — a Civilized Dwarf at
Agility 5 goes under it on walking modifiers alone. It is simply no longer load-bearing for these two.
The mis-keying itself is *not* acted on: correcting a disease resistance on an inference is his call,
and the evidence rather than the conclusion is what went to him in `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 24.

**The lesson worth keeping:** a clamp that turns a wrong number into a plausible one hides the
question instead of answering it. The floor was a legitimate rule applied to an illegitimate input,
which is the most comfortable kind of mistake to leave in place.

### 2026-09-12 — Special movement is a formula, not a number, and the port copies it through as text

> **Superseded in part.** The claim below that the preview zeros were his gap is wrong — see the
> entry above. The relative-rate mechanic it describes is real, but the formula it gives
> (`base × multiplier + mod`) is **not uniform across movement kinds**; the corrections are recorded
> at the end of this entry.

The user noticed the preview sheet showing Walk and Jog at 0/0/0 and asked that it be fixed in the
long run. The test sheet was the symptom; there are two causes underneath it, and only one of them
is ours.

**It is not the harness.** `setMovementFromRace` (actor-character.mjs:691) does run, and the preview
does call `prepareDerivedData()`. The zeros are real, and they are correct — the preview character is
a **Human(Civilized:Village)**, one of fourteen races that genuinely have no usable movement in his
data. That half is `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 23, verified against his raw 62-column rows so it is not
a column-map slip on our side.

**The half that is ours: every special rate in his sheet is written relative to another rate.**
`special.hourly` does not hold a number. It holds the NAME of a base rate — `"Walk"` or `"Run"` —
with `hourlyMultiplier` and `hourlyMod` sitting beside it, and the same three fields again for
`tenSec` and `oneSec`. The rule is:

```
special rate = <the named base rate> x multiplier + mod
```

| Race | Special | Reads as |
|---|---|---|
| Apocritara, Avian, Gryphara | Fly | Walk × 4 |
| Djinn, Gremlin | Fly | **Run** × 3 |
| Centaur | Gallop | Walk × 4 |
| Brachara, Elf(Sea) | Swim | Walk × 3 |
| Arachen | Scurry | Walk × 4 **+ 4** hourly, **+ 40** per ten seconds |

**26 of the 105 races use it**, and the base rate is not always Walk — Djinn and Gremlin fly from
Run, and Arachen carries a non-zero additive on top of the multiplier, so neither the base nor the
`+ mod` can be assumed away.

**The race side already models this correctly and the data is intact.** `item-race.mjs` declares
`special.hourly` as a **StringField** holding the base-rate name, with `hourlyMultiplier` and
`hourlyMod` as numbers beside it, and the same trio again for each scale. Its own comment says the
multiplier and modifier fields exist "because some races derive their special rate from another rate
rather than stating it outright" — so the mechanic was understood when the schema was written.

**Where it stops is the character.** `_prepareMovement` (actor-character.mjs:697) loops over
`["walk", "jog", "run"]` only, then copies `specialName`, `jumpStand` and `jumpUp`. **It never
assigns `movement.special` at all**, so the character's special rate sits at its schema default of
zero forever. The character's own `special` is a plain `movementRateField()` of three NumberFields,
which is the right shape for a *resolved* rate — the resolver is simply absent.

The visible symptom is therefore a **Gallop row of 0 / 0 / 0** on a Centaur, not the word "Walk":
`specialName` is copied, so the row appears and is labelled, and then reads as motionless. The data
was extracted correctly and modelled correctly; only the derivation step is missing. This is a port
gap, and it is why the two findings looked like one problem from the outside.

**Decision:** resolve the formula in `setMovementFromRace` rather than at display time, so the
derived model holds real numbers and every consumer — sheet, chat card, future travel rules — sees a
distance rather than a word. Walk, jog and run stay straight copies; only `special` is resolved.
Handed to Sonnet with the mechanic written out, since the judgement was the diagnosis and what
remains is arithmetic: `docs/sonnet/2026-09-12-special-movement.md`.

**CORRECTIONS to the above, from reading `calcSpecialMovement` (sheet-worker.js:32110) in full:**

1. **"Walk, jog and run stay straight copies" is wrong** — they are the Agility base plus the race's
   modifier. See the entry above. This is now implemented and is what fixed the preview sheet.
2. **The `+ mod` term is not universal.** It applies to **Scurry only**. Gallop and Swim multiply
   with no additive; Slither multiplies with neither an additive nor the race speed multiplier, and
   additionally **zeroes walk, jog, run and both jumps** — *"Slither is the only movement sssssnake
   people have."* Writing one formula for all five kinds would have been wrong for four of them.
3. **There is a third base-rate name: `INT`.** Magical flight reads Intelligence directly and, per
   his comment, *"never has a multiplier, even for speed"*; the hourly and ten-second rates are
   `× 30` and the one-second `× 3`. Two races use it. The handoff note had said to stop and report
   if a third name appeared rather than mapping it by guess — it appeared.
4. **A special multiplier of 0 also means ×1**, by the same sentinel rule as the speed multiplier.

**A near-miss worth recording.** Seven race names came back from the console looking corrupted —
`Se'eth` as `Se?eth`. Checked before reporting: the character is `0x2019`, a typographic apostrophe,
correctly stored. It was the console's rendering, not the data. That is the second misread caught by
checking this session, after the syntax-check harness's module count, and both would have gone into
the record as defects that do not exist.

### 2026-09-12 — Where a design document and the shipped code disagree, the code wins

**The standing conflict rule had a gap.** `CLAUDE.md` settles Roll20-sheet-versus-rulebook: the sheet
wins. It says nothing about *our own* design documents versus *our own* shipped code, and that
case has now occurred.

`docs/DATA-MODEL.md` was written on 2026-09-10 as a design pass, before the sheet-worker had been
read end to end. It still described itself as "Proposal for review — not yet implemented" while
both schemas it proposed had in fact been built, and two of its statements had gone stale in a way
that would mislead rather than merely lag:

- **§9 step 2** documented the Master's Manual attribute-max tiers, 23 / 25 / 27 / 30 by title.
  Those were removed from the code on 2026-09-11 (see "CORRECTION: a character's attribute maximum
  follows his sheet") because nothing in his sheet implements them. The doc was still teaching the
  rule the code had deliberately rejected.
- **§1's source table** listed *Mysteries of the Planes* as a book not in hand, and drew a "~36% of
  skills come from books we don't have" conclusion from it. The book has since been extracted; the
  real figure is ~20%, across three books.

**Decision:** `DATA-MODEL.md` now carries an explicit precedence note in its header — read it for the
*reasoning*, read the code for the *rule* — and both drifts are corrected **in the doc, not the
code**. Nothing shipped changed in this pass. The document's job from here is to explain why the
model looks the way it does; it is no longer a specification anything is built from.

**Why this matters more than tidiness.** This project is handed back to the dev, who will read the
docs before the source. A design document that confidently states a rule the code rejected is worse
than no document, because it reads as current. The four `CORRECTION:` entries above exist because
the same failure mode keeps recurring in the code; this is the first time it has been caught in the
prose.

**Also reconciled:** of the doc's six open questions, four were answered by work done between
2026-09-11 and 2026-09-12 without anyone going back to close them out — sourcebook gating is content
only, the creature schema is separate and leaner, his flattened attribute tables are followed, and
saves-versus-skills turned out to use two different rules exactly as question 4 had guessed. A fifth
is partly answered. **The one that is still genuinely open — "is `sheet-worker.js` current?" — has
grown teeth:** when it was written it guarded ~7,000 unextracted rows, and it now sits underneath
4,367 built documents and every combat rule in the system. It stays on the board as blocking Epic 6,
and it is the one question here worth putting to the dev directly.

### 2026-09-14 — Off-hand fighting, second half: the Knowledge buy-down, and a genuine blocker on Lore's seconds

The two remaining lore-title tables generated cleanly (`get2ndWeaponKnowWhen`, `get2ndWeaponLoreWhen`
into `classLoreTitles.json` beside the existing five, following the pattern exactly), giving
`secondWeaponKnowTitle` / `secondWeaponLoreTitle` on the class item. 22 of 92 classes ever reach
Second Weapon Knowledge, 19 of 92 reach Second Weapon Lore.

**Eligibility and the skill's own chance are two different things, and both are now real.** A
character derives `hasSecondWeaponKnowledge` / `hasSecondWeaponLore` from class + title exactly as
the other four lores do (`hasLore`). But unlike those, holding the discipline is not binary — the
skill's own resolved percentage decides how much it buys back, so a new step,
`_prepareOffhandSkills()`, runs immediately after `_prepareSkills()` and reads a named skill's
`totalChance` straight off the actor's embedded items. It could not live inside `_prepareCombat`,
which runs *before* `_prepareSkills` in `prepareDerivedData()` — items are prepared in title/class
order and a skill's `totalChance` is not finished yet when combat derives. Rather than reorder
existing derivation (risking something else depending on the current order), this is a small
step of its own, immediately after skills. Not eligible reads identically to no skill at all: zero,
whether the reason is a missing title or a missing item.

**The buy-down itself matches his sheet exactly** (`setSecondWeaponKnowValues`,
sheet-worker.js:83152-83198): `floor(chance / 20)` levels, each buying back one point of melee and
damage penalty and 5% of skill penalty, off the *same* banded tables the full-penalty tier reads —
his code seeds `tempOffHandToHit` etc. from `combat_mod_tohit_offhand` and its siblings before
subtracting the levels, which are exactly `getOffhandMeleeAdj` and its siblings. The reduction can
cancel the penalty but never turns it positive (`if (tempOffHandToHit>0) { tempOffHandToHit=0; }`,
three times over) — floored at zero on all three figures independently, not just when all three
would cross at once.

**Second Weapon Lore's seconds discount is genuinely blocked, and this is a finding rather than
something to invent.** The half-two note asked to work out where an off-hand attack's seconds cost
comes from before writing the discount, and to stop and raise it if his sheet never charges the
extra second anywhere. It does not. Every reference to `offhand_2nd_lore_seconds` was checked:
it is computed once (`secondWeaponKnowLevels` for Lore, capped at 5,
sheet-worker.js:83242-83250), stored, and read back exactly once — into the *display* string
`"2nd Weapon Lore[...](Offhand Seconds): +N"` at line 82666. **It is never subtracted from a
weapon's speed, an attack's cost, or anything the round tracker touches.** This is the same shape
as `MLDamMod` (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 21) — a value computed, shown, and mechanically inert —
except here there is no base cost anywhere in his sheet for the discount to reduce. The RESOLVED
design answer ("fighting off-handed COSTS seconds, and ambidexterity is the absence of that cost")
gives the *direction*, but not the number: what does an un-bought-down off-hand attack cost, in
seconds, that five levels of Lore reduce to nothing? His sheet never picked one, so this port
cannot invent one without it being exactly that — invented, not ported. **Left open, put to the
user rather than guessed at.** Nothing was built for it; `resolveOffhandPenalties`'s "lore" tier
still removes only the to-hit/damage/skill penalty, matching what his code actually executes for a
Lore-flagged weapon.

**Creatures do not use any of this** (`2026-09-12-offhand-planning.md` item 4, now answered).
`handleCreatureAttack` (sheet-worker.js:179717-180022) was read in full: no reference to off-hand,
second weapon, or hand at all. Structurally this could not be otherwise — a creature's ten attack
slots are an encoded string of named attacks, not weapons assigned to a hand, so "which hand" has
no meaning for a creature attack in his model. The creature-branch code inside
`setGeneralCombatModifierDisplay` that reads `getCreatureSkillChance(..., "Second Weapon Knowledge")`
is display-only and feeds the same dead-end `offhand_2nd_weapon_tohit` path characters use, which a
creature's attack resolver never reads. The creature model needs no `hand` field and no port of any
of this.

**Verified:** 335 combat tests pass (5 new: the buy-down at 0%/20%/39%/60%/100% chance, pinning the
floor and the "never past zero" rule independently per figure). 173 derivation tests (11 new:
title eligibility below/at/above threshold, chance zero with no skill, chance zero when eligible
but untrained, the real chance coming through once both eligible and trained, and that Knowledge
and Lore read two separate named skills). Creature 129 and availability 39 unchanged; 26 modules
parse. The sheet preview was reloaded and shows no console errors; it needed no changes, since the
buy-down only affects roll-time numbers in `attack.mjs`, not anything the weapon-row builder shows.

**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14 — that the computed chance actually reaches
a live roll and that the off-hand-flagged weapon's to-hit/damage change on the chat card. No V14
install exists on this machine.

### 2026-09-14 — The description tab: 19 fields and a language list, made reachable

Built the fifth PART the earlier finding called for. `templates/actor/tab-description.hbs`, a
`description` entry in `PARTS` and `TABS` on `ImagineCharacterSheet`, and the label in `lang/en.json`.
Nothing about the mechanism is new — it follows the four existing PARTs exactly, and the languages
array reuses the creature attack's rider-effect pattern (an indexed row, Add/Delete actions that
replace the whole array, plain `name="system.languages.{{index}}.field"` bindings for everything
else, which `submitOnChange` writes back on its own).

**Layout groups the four things by kind, not by field count.** Physical Features (eleven fields:
height, weight, frame, hair, eyes, skin, body covering, age, apparent age, maximum age — every one
of `physical`'s fields except `handedness`), Wealth (four currency numbers plus gems/jewelry/special
as free text), and Languages sit as three `.panel`s in the same `.panel-row` the race sheet already
established for this kind of dense plain-field editing; Tendencies sits above them as a single row,
next to Alignment's role in the header. `handedness` was deliberately left on the Combat tab and not
duplicated — it drives shield coverage and off-hand resolution, so it belongs beside what reads it.

**The Intelligence language allowance is rendered, not computed.** `this.attributes.int.mods` already
carries `spokenLanguages` / `writtenLanguages` for every rating, because `_prepareAttributes` copies
the whole matching row out of `ATTRIBUTE_TABLES` generically for every attribute — nothing new was
wired for this tab. The line is guarded by `{{#if}}` and simply does not print if the value is ever
absent, exactly as the finding specified: this tab renders what exists, and wiring the cap itself
stays the Attributes module's job (Epic 2, Backlog).

**No new Handlebars helpers.** The lore panel had already established the pattern of precomputing
booleans and joined strings in the sheet class rather than templating `{{#if (or a b)}}`, because
whether Foundry's environment ships those combinators cannot be checked from here. Nothing in this
tab needed even that — every conditional is a single value or an `{{#each}}`, so the template stays
inside what the preview harness's own helper stub (`eq`/`gt`/`lt`/`gte`/`localize`) already proves out.

**Verified:** all four suites unchanged (combat 335, derivation 173, creature 129, availability 39) —
expected, since nothing here is new derivation, only new surface on values that already existed. 26
modules parse. The tab was checked in `tools/sheet-preview.html` against a real derived character
with every new field given a genuine value rather than left at a schema default — including the
Intelligence line reading "4 spoken, 2 written" off her actual rating, which is the check the note
asked for specifically: "not a hand-typed stub, which is how a field that never populates goes
unnoticed."

**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14 — that the Add/Delete language buttons
write back to the actor, and that the fields in general persist. No V14 install exists on this
machine, and the preview harness does not wire `data-action` clicks at all (nor does any of the
sheet's other action-driven UI, which carries the identical caveat already).

### 2026-09-14 — A character's Skills tab shows the class skills around its current title

`docs/sonnet/2026-09-12-elemental-dancer.md` item 3, built. `getClassSkills(title)` on
`item-class.mjs`, parallel to the existing `getTitleName(title)` — same 1-based indexing, same
"outside the range" empty-string return. The Skills tab shows three rows around the character's
current title (one below, current, one above) when the class has anything recorded, and nothing
at all otherwise, which is what 85 of the 87 classes do — his `classtitledict` never carried the
skills gained at each title, only the title names, so `classSkills` is empty for everything built
from the sheet-worker and populated only for classes hand-authored from a Word template.
Angle-bracketed placeholders ("`<1st Kinesis>`", "`<Call of Element>`") are shown exactly as
written rather than resolved or hidden, since resolving them needs the element the player chose,
which lives nowhere in the schema yet.

**Verifying this needed the real Elemental Dancer document, not a hand-typed stub**, and the sheet
preview's existing character is a Warrior with nothing to show. Rather than swap her class and
risk destabilising every other fixture built around her (weapons, lore flags, the attack card), a
second, minimal render was added lower on the same preview page: the real `classes.json` entry for
Elemental Dancer, at title 7, through the same `tab-skills.hbs` template. This reuses the pattern
the shield pass already accepted for weapon rows — `#buildClassProgress` is a private static
method on the sheet class, so its dozen lines are duplicated in the harness with a comment to keep
it in step, rather than making it non-private to suit a test, which would have been inconsistent
with every other `#build*` helper on the class.

**One rendering trap, caught by an unexpectedly collapsed `<div>`:** the preview's own CSS is
`.tab { display: none; } .tab.active { display: block; }`, and only the elements inside `#tabs`
ever get `.active` toggled by the tab-switching script. The second render landed in its own
`#ed-check` container outside that script's reach, so the section rendered — 1,613 characters of
real HTML — at a height of exactly 0. Fixed by adding `.active` to the rendered `.tab` by hand
right after inserting it.

**Verified:** the real Elemental Dancer document at title 7 shows titles 6, 7 and 8 with their
real class skills, title 7 marked current; the Warrior fixture shows no panel at all
(`buildClassProgress(...).show === false`, asserted and silent). All four suites unchanged
(combat 335, derivation 173, creature 129, availability 39 — expected, since this is presentation
of an already-existing field) and 26 modules parse. `tools/item-preview.html` was also reloaded,
since `item-class.mjs` changed, and shows no console errors.

**Also closed in the same pass, `docs/sonnet/2026-09-12-elemental-dancer.md` item 4:**
`Beguiler`'s row is a full 22 columns, unlike Monk's, so item 22's parsing-defect explanation does
not apply. Its `description` and `classType` cells are simply transposed against every other
class's pattern (index 9 is always the long paragraph, index 10 the short type, and Beguiler has
the two swapped) — a one-row data-entry slip, filed as `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 27 rather than
silently reordered.

**Not done, and blocked on source material, not on effort:** items 1 and 2 of the same note —
authoring Elementalist, Inquisitor and Summoner from their Word templates (GME is confirmed a
Game-Master stand-in, not a playable class, per the comment already on `skillSlotsNeeded`), and
filling `classSkills` for the 85 other generated classes. Both need documents this session does
not have.

### 2026-09-14 — Lore corrections, item 1 done; item 2 turned out to be a real gap, not a UI question

**Item 1, the chat card's lore note, is built.** `damage.lore` and `damage.projectileLore` were
already computed and flagged; the card's damage breakdown now shows both, with `damage.loreSpecific`
distinguishing the general tier from a weapon named in the list. The to-hit contribution needed no
new code at all — `getToHitModifiers` already pushes a `{label:"Lore", value:N}` entry (and an
`{label:"Off Hand", value:N}` one) onto the list the attack-line already iterates generically, so
both were showing on the card before this pass touched anything.

**Item 2 was framed as "mirror the panel, or decide it does not belong."** Checking properly found
a third answer: **his sheet applies a real numeric Weapon/Missile Lore bonus to creature attacks,
and the port does not.** This is not the display-only question the note anticipated.

`setCombatModifierValues` (sheet-worker.js:82167) branches for a creature exactly as it does for a
character, at lines 82266 and 82294: `getCreatureSkillChance(tmpCreatureSkillList, "Weapon Lore")`
(and "Missile Lore"), and if the creature's chance is non-zero at all, `whenWeaponLoreAcquired=1`
against `currentTitle=tmpCreatureLevel` — which is true for a creature of any level once it has the
skill, with no title threshold the way a class has one. That sets the same
`tempmeleemodweaponlore=2` / `tempdamagemodweaponlore=4` / `tempmodskillweaponlore=10` a character
gets, into `combat_mod_melee_other` and `combat_mod_missile_other`. **`handleCreatureAttack`
(179717) reads both of those fields directly** — they are in its own `getAttrs` list — so a
creature that lists "Weapon Lore" or "Missile Lore" among its skills really does fight with the
general bonus in his sheet.

`module/combat/creature-attack.mjs` has no reference to `getLoreModifiers` or the `LORE_*`
constants at all. `combat.hasWeaponLore` / `hasMissileLore` are derived on the creature model
(`_prepareCombat`, `actor-creature.mjs:509-510`) and used for exactly one thing — choosing
`loreAttackSkill`, the Lore attack chart — never for a numeric bonus.

**Why this is not fixed here.** A creature has no per-weapon lore list the way a character does
(there is nothing in his creature data resembling `weapon_lore_list`), so only the general tier
could ever apply — but a creature's ten attack slots mix melee, missile and shaped attacks (touch,
gaze, cloud, bolt...) with different to-hit paths already, and deciding how a flat "this creature
has Weapon Lore" fact should reach each of those without a specific `getLoreModifiers`-shaped
mechanism is a design question, not a mechanical extension of the existing pattern. Left for a
proper pass with the same care the character-side lore work got, rather than wired in quickly to
close out a checklist item.

**`docs/sonnet/2026-09-12-lore-corrections.md` item 2 is rewritten** to record this rather than
its original framing, and is no longer a Sonnet-tier item.

**Item 3** (the `speedSpecial` sweep) is unaffected by any of this and is built separately — see
below.

**Verified for item 1:** 335 combat tests unchanged (no new rule logic, only a new field on an
already-computed object and a template change); the chat card was checked by hand against the
existing `damage.lore` / `damage.projectileLore` shapes already produced by
`getLoreModifiers`/`getProjectileLoreDamage`, both covered by existing tests.

### 2026-09-14 — Item 3 done, and a real drift found in the preview's duplicated weapon-row builder

`docs/sonnet/2026-09-12-lore-corrections.md` item 3: confirmed a `speedSpecial` weapon's displayed
speed is unaffected by lore. `#buildWeaponRows` on the sheet class is private, so this could not be
tested from `tools/combat-test.html` at all — the note's own "Done when" named the wrong file. The
sheet preview is the only place that logic runs, so a real Garrote (`speedSpecial: true`) was added
to the preview's weapon list, specifically lored (added to `weaponLoreList` alongside the Bastard
Sword, which already carries a real -2 speed modifier from that lore), and its rendered speed
column checked: it reads **"Special"**, not a number, exactly as a plain unlored Garrote would.

**Found on the way: the preview's own duplicate of `#buildWeaponRows` had already drifted from the
real one.** The comment beside it says "kept in sync" is required; it had not been. The real sheet
class adds the weapon's own lore speed modifier into `getWeaponSpeed` (`tmpspeedmod +
tmplore.speed`); the preview's copy passed `character.combat.weaponSpeedMod` alone, silently
dropping the lore term for every weapon rendered there — which is exactly how a field that never
populates goes unnoticed, the same principle the description-tab pass was built around. Fixed to
match. This means the Bastard Sword's displayed speed in the preview was wrong (too slow by the 2
seconds her Weapon Lore should have bought back) until this pass, though `tools/combat-test.html`'s
own coverage of `getWeaponSpeed` and `getLoreModifiers` was never affected, since neither of those
pure functions had the bug — only this one duplicate call site did.

**The sample chat card was also a hand-typed stub for lore**, built before Weapon Lore or off-hand
fighting existed: it called `getToHitModifiers`/`getWeaponSpeed` without their `lore`/`offhand`
parameters at all and hand-assembled a `damage` object with no `lore` field, so item 1's new
chat-card line would have rendered against this stub with nothing to show — passing by omission,
not by proof. Rewired to compute the sword's real lore contribution with `getLoreModifiers` and
feed it through to-hit, speed and damage exactly as `attack.mjs` does, so the card now shows a real
`+6 lore (specific)` on the damage line and `Lore +3` on the to-hit line, both reflecting the
character's actual Weapon Lore rather than a value that was never wired.

**Verified:** all four suites unchanged (335/173/129/39 — this was presentation and a preview-only
fix, no rule-layer change), 26 modules parse. The preview was reloaded and its Garrote row confirmed
"Special", the Bastard Sword and Dagger rows confirmed real lore-adjusted numbers, and the chat
card confirmed both its to-hit and damage lines now carry the sword's real lore contribution.

### 2026-09-14 — Projectile Lore's remaining items: exercised, tested, and one cross-check that
turned out to have no data to check against

`docs/sonnet/2026-09-12-projectile-lore.md`, items 1 through 4.

**Item 1, the Lore panel with all three rows, and item 2, the chat card's projectile damage
line, both confirmed with a real Archer** rather than the Warrior fixture, who never acquires
Projectile Lore. Archer's own titles (weapon 12, missile 3, projectile 7) all land at or before
title 12, so a single character genuinely holds all three at once — the exact case item 1 asked
for — built as a second, isolated render on the sheet preview, the same pattern the Elemental
Dancer class-progression check established: `#buildLorePanel` is a private static method, so its
half-dozen lines are duplicated with the same "keep in sync" comment, fed by the real `hasLore()`
rule function against the real Archer document's title fields rather than hand-typed booleans.
The rendered panel reads "Weapon, Missile, Projectile" and the projectile input carries
`Arrow(Long Bow/Normal)`, both from real data. Item 2's line was actually already built as a side
effect of the lore-corrections pass two entries above — `{{#if damage.projectileLore}}` sits in
the same span as the weapon-lore line — so this pass exercised it rather than writing it: a real
`Bow(Long)` attack, resolved through the real `getProjectileLoreDamage`, shows
**"+10 projectile lore (2/die)"** on the chat card, and the bow's displayed speed (2) correctly
shows the general Missile Lore -1 absorbed by the weapon's own minimum speed of 2 — a real,
if unglamorous, confirmation that Projectile Lore carries no speed term of its own (its return
shape has no `.speed` at all, unlike Weapon/Missile Lore) and that the two subsystems compose
correctly on one weapon.

**Item 3, the derivation tests, mirror the existing Weapon/Missile Lore block exactly**: title
eligibility below, at and above the threshold; independence from the other two lores; a class
holding all three; the stored list parsed into names; an unset list reading empty. `makeCharacter`
gained `projectileLoreList` in its `extra` fixture, matching the pattern already there for the
other two.

**Item 4 turned out to have no data to cross-check at all, which is itself the finding.** The
proposed check was whether the six Projectile-Lore classes are the same six whose `skilldict`
entries include a "Projectile Lore" skill. `skilldict` carries exactly **one** "Projectile Lore"
skill document, generic and undifferentiated (attr, rating, category "class"), with no
class-specific association anywhere in it — his skills are drawn from category-wide slot
allowances, not a per-class list of named skills. The only place a class-to-skill mapping exists
at all is `advancement.classSkills`, which is empty for all 86 classes his own data builds and
populated only where a Word template has been hand-authored (Elemental Dancer, so far) — and none
of the six Projectile-Lore classes has one. So the comparison the note proposed cannot be run with
data that exists today; this is neither an agreement nor a disagreement to record, but an absent
premise, and is recorded as such rather than forced into one of the two boxes the note offered.

**Verified:** derivation 180 (7 new), combat 335 unchanged, creature 129 and availability 39
unchanged, 26 modules parse. Sheet preview reloaded clean, both new isolated renders (the Lore
panel and the Long Bow's chat card) checked against their real computed values.

**Item 5** stays blocked on the developer's answer to `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 21, as before.

### 2026-09-14 — Off-hand fighting's last two blockers, both answered by the developer

The two questions raised at the end of the second-half pass -- what an off-hand attack costs in
seconds before Second Weapon Lore's levels reduce it, and whether creatures take an off-hand
penalty at all -- were put to W. Michael Tenery III directly, since neither could be answered from
his sheet. Both came back:

> "If you are not ambidextrous you only get 5 seconds to use in your off hand. An extra second in
> your off hand means you get an additional second, so 5 becomes 6 seconds in your off hand. If
> you are ambidextrous this does not apply as you are already getting 10 seconds in each hand.
>
> Creatures do take off hand penalties (if they use off hands like an off hand claw attack), unless
> they have the Ability: Ambidextrous, or Omnidextrous."

**The 5-second figure is real and independently confirmed in the Player's Guide** ("Timing in the
Combat Round", p.178): "A character is only allowed 5 seconds (half of the 10 second round) to
perform actions in his off hand. The exception to this is ambidextrous characters, who are allowed
the full 10 seconds for both hands." The Second Weapon Lore skill entry (p.14463) matches too: "the
non-ambidextrous practitioner can use the weapon faster in the off-hand... For each 20% of the
skill, the practitioner gains 1 additional second. The off-hand bonus cannot cause the total time
to exceed 10 seconds." This resolves the earlier finding cleanly: his sheet was never missing a
base cost to discount from (`docs/DECISIONS.md`, "second half" entry above) -- the base cost is a
fixed rulebook constant a player tracks by hand, and `offhand_2nd_lore_seconds` was only ever the
sheet's way of telling them how many extra seconds that constant grows to. Nothing in his sheet
subtracts it from anything because there is nothing computed to subtract it FROM.

**Built as `getOffhandSecondsCap(handedness, secondWeaponLoreChance)`** in `combat-rules.mjs`: 5 by
default, `+ min(5, floor(chance/20))` for Second Weapon Lore, 10 outright for Ambidextrous (matching
`setSecondWeaponLoreValues`, sheet-worker.js:83242-83250, which writes 0 extra seconds for an
Ambidextrous character rather than the level count -- so returning 10 directly, instead of 5 +
levels, is the same answer by the more direct route). Wired into `_prepareOffhandSkills()` on the
character model, right beside the `secondWeaponLoreChance` it consumes, and shown on the Combat tab
next to Weapon Speed. **This is exposed as a cap, not enforced as a pool.** The book's own worked
example (p.27824-27851, Orgo's rapier and longsword) and its rule about losing off-hand seconds
proportionally to a bad initiative roll both describe a resource a player tracks through a round,
which would mean new per-combatant, per-round state on `ImagineCombat` (`combat-document.mjs`
currently tracks nothing but `initiative`) -- an architecture-locking addition the model-choice
protocol says to raise before building, not decide alone mid-pass. Exposing the computed number
follows the same precedent as `damageAbsorb`: give the player the figure, let them spend it by
hand, same as his own sheet does (it computes and displays the discount; it never subtracts
anything from a round tracker of its own either). **Round-tracker enforcement is left open, to
raise with the user rather than build unasked.**

**Creatures DO take the penalty -- overriding, not contradicting, the earlier finding.** The prior
entry ("Creatures do not use any of this", the second-half write-up above) was correct about what
`handleCreatureAttack` actually contains: zero references to off-hand, second weapon, or hand, and
no `hand` field anywhere on his creature attack encoding. That finding stands as a fact about his
code. It does not, it turns out, describe the whole ruleset -- this is the developer adding a rule
his sheet never automated for creatures, not a correction to a misreading. His own creature ability
dictionary already supports it: `"Ambidextrous"`, `"Fully Ambidextrous"` and `"Omnidextrous"` are
real entries there (all three inside the `@MARKER CREATURE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS BELOW` section), and
all three carry the identical mechanical description -- "10 seconds... and no penalties" -- just
over a different span of limbs (`Ambidextrous`: the primary pair; `Fully Ambidextrous`: all limbs;
`Omnidextrous`: every limb independently). That a creature could be built with one of these
abilities while its attacks structurally had no way to read it was the gap; the abilities were
never the gap.

**Built by extending the already-tested character pattern rather than porting anything,** since
there is nothing on the creature side to port:
- `item-creature-attack.mjs` gains a `hand` field, `"" | "left" | "right" | "both"`. Blank is not a
  fourth hand -- it means "not hand-based at all" (a bite, a tail slap, a breath), and is load-bearing:
  a weapon's `hand` defaults an unset value to `"right"` (`isOffhandWeapon`'s `tmphand ?? "right"`),
  which would misread every blank creature attack as a left-of-right-handed off-hand strike if fed
  through unguarded. The call site in `creature-attack.mjs` only asks `resolveOffhandPenalties` at
  all when `tmpa.hand` is truthy, sidestepping the default rather than changing it -- `isOffhandWeapon`
  keeps its existing, tested behaviour for weapons untouched.
- `actor-creature.mjs` derives `combat.offhandHandedness` in `_prepareCombat`: `"Ambidextrous"` when
  the trait list contains "Ambidextrous" or "Omnidextrous" (a substring check catches "Fully
  Ambidextrous" too, since it contains "Ambidextrous"), else the creature's own stored
  `identity.handedness` (blank reading as right-handed, as it already does for shield placement).
  The ability wins outright rather than deferring to a stored handedness, since that field is only
  ever about which side a shield covers -- a creature could plausibly have both set at once (Left
  for its shield, Ambidextrous for its attacks) and both should be honoured on their own terms.
- `getCreatureToHitModifiers` / `getCreatureDamageMods` in `creature-rules.mjs` gain an `offhand`
  parameter, mirroring the character-side `getToHitModifiers`/damage functions exactly (a plain
  labelled entry in the generic modifier list, so the chat card's `{{#each mods.list}}` shows it for
  free, the same way Lore's line needed no template change).
- `creature-attack.mjs` computes `resolveOffhandPenalties(tmpa, agility, offhandHandedness, 0)` once
  per attack (guarded by `tmpa.hand`, as above) and feeds `.melee` into to-hit and `.damage` into the
  damage roll. The `0` for Second Weapon Knowledge chance is deliberate: creatures have no
  per-attack Knowledge/Lore item flags to buy the penalty down (unlike a character's weapon), so it
  always resolves to the plain Agility-banded `"full"` tier once it applies -- `resolveOffhandPenalties`
  needed no change to behave this way, since a creature attack's `system` object simply has no
  `secondWeaponLore`/`secondWeaponKnowledge` fields for it to find.
- The Combat tab's attack table gained the same L/R/2H hand picker and "off" tag the weapon table
  has, plus a fourth "not hand-based" option the weapon picker does not need (a weapon is never
  handless). The item sheet gained a matching Hand field.

**Verified:** combat 345 (10 new, on `getOffhandSecondsCap`), derivation 184 (4 new, the cap at
various Lore chances and handedness), creature 139 (10 new: 6 on `offhandHandedness` under
blank/stored/Ambidextrous/Fully Ambidextrous/Omnidextrous/override-vs-stored, 4 on the `offhand`
parameter reaching both creature modifier functions), availability 39 unchanged, 26 modules parse.
`tools/creature-preview.html`'s duplicated `#buildAttackRows` (the same "keep in sync" duplication
already caught drifting once this session, in the weapon-row builder) was updated alongside the
real one and reloaded: the Cave Wyrm's Claw was given a left hand for the fixture, and with the
wyrm's blank handedness reading right-handed, the Combat tab shows it tagged "off" with the hand
picker showing "L" selected, and Bite/Tail Slap/Frost Breath/Withering Gaze all show no tag with
"—" selected, exactly as attacks with no hand at all should. The character sheet preview's Combat
tab shows a new "Off-Hand Seconds: 5, of the round" box next to Weapon Speed. The item sheet preview
shows the new Hand field on Frost Breath, correctly defaulted to "Not hand-based".

**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14. Also not built, and deliberately left
open rather than decided alone: whether the off-hand seconds cap should become an enforced,
spendable pool on the round tracker -- see the note under the seconds-cap section above.

### 2026-09-16 — The Skills module's four open items, and one that was already done

`docs/PROGRESS.md`'s Skills row listed five things outstanding. **Item 5 was stale and is now
corrected: `getSlotsNeededForClass` is already extracted** -- `class_skill_slots_needed()` has been
in `tools/extract/extract_combat_tables.py` since the class pass, and every one of the 87 class
documents carries `skillSlotsNeeded` (Acrobat 42, Assassin 56, and so on) with the field on
`item-class.mjs`. Nothing was rebuilt; the row was wrong, not the code.

**Duplicate skills are rolled once per copy, best taken.** Player's Guide, "Duplicate Class and
Racial Skills": a character may hold the same skill both racially and as a class skill, and then
"a skill roll can be made for each multiple of the same skill, and the best roll can be chosen",
with his own worked example of a Civilized Human Rogue's Move Unseen -- a failure beside a success
is a success, and a critical beside an ordinary success may be taken as the critical. **The copies
do not share a chance**, since each carries its own bonuses, so each is resolved against its own
and only then compared; `pickBestSkillRoll` therefore takes resolved results rather than one chance
and a handful of dice. Ranking is by outcome in `SKILL_OUTCOMES` order, and where two rolls share
an outcome the wider margin is named the chosen one -- that tie-break is presentation only (two
ordinary successes do the same thing) and is commented as such. Every roll is shown on the card,
not just the winner, because the book leaves the choice with the player.

**His sheet does not contradict this.** Its only duplicate handling is a guard at selection time
that refuses the same skill twice *within* the racial list (sheet-worker.js:7017, "A duplicate
skill was selected. Nothing done."), which is compatible with the book: no duplicates inside a
category, duplicates across categories rolled twice.

**The slot tricks are ported at his rates, from his four conversion functions**, not from the
book's prose: racial buys a class slot one for one (52649) or two social slots (52336), and two
social slots buy back one racial (56119) or one class slot (56433). **There is no fifth function**
-- nothing converts out of class, which is why `SLOT_TRANSFERS` has no class row and the sheet
shows no such button. A slot may also be given up outright for 2d4% on a skill already held
(52310, and the social twin at 55824 rolls the same 2d4), added to that skill's own modifier and
deliberately not floored at zero, as his code adds it.

**The moves are stored as counts, the allowance is derived.** Six counters on the character
(`skillSlotMoves`) mirror what his sheet stores in `tmp_race_skill_slots_removed` and its siblings;
`getSlotAllowance` applies them to Knowledge's figures. The base figures are kept beside the
adjusted ones so the tab can show what a trade cost ("13, was 14"). A trade needs the slot it
spends to still be unused, which is his guard ("There are no open slots to convert", 7353), tested
against what is left rather than against the allowance. **One of his guards is deliberately not
ported**: social-to-racial also requires racial to have an unavailable slot to open into (7607),
which is his twenty-row sheet running out of rows rather than a rule.

**Over-allocation is flagged, not prevented.** His sheet refuses outright ("More selected than
total slots. Nothing done.", 7049) -- but it refuses at a character-generation step this port has
not built, and a skill here is an Item that can be dropped on an actor from anywhere. Flagging
matches how availability already marks an item that should not be there without deleting it, and
leaves the Game Master the last word. The comparison needed its own derivation step,
`_prepareSkillSlotStatus`, because the allowance is made before skills are prepared and the used
counts during -- the same ordering problem `_prepareOffhandSkills` has.

**Untrained rolls take the base chance and nothing else.** Player's Guide, "Who Can Use a Skill":
"a character may attempt almost any skill in the game, whether or not he has actually learned or
acquired the skill... The common skill chance is simply the base chance without the starting
bonus." Two limits in the same passage are the caller's rather than the formula's: a skill already
held is rolled as itself ("any skill for which the character has rolled a starting bonus can no
longer be attempted as a common skill"), and a restricted skill cannot be tried at all.

**The restricted flag has nowhere to read from, and that is a finding.** `isRestricted` is already
on the skill schema, and the picker honours it -- but **his `skilldict` has no restricted column at
all**. Comparing rows shows the seventh column is learn time, not restriction: Climb carries "32"
there and Second Weapon Lore, which the book marks `Restricted: Yes`, carries "". Restriction is
stated per skill in the book and was never brought across, so all 674 extracted skills read as
unrestricted today. Filtering on the flag now rather than later means nothing has to be rewired
when it is populated; extracting it from the book is left written down rather than guessed at from
the blank learn time, which is a correlation and not the datum.

**Verified:** derivation 227 (44 new: the four trade rates, both sacrifices, the open-slot guards,
over-allocation flagged on a real character holding one class skill too many, the untrained chance
against a held skill's own, and the book's two worked duplicate-skill examples), combat 345,
creature 139 and availability 39 unchanged, 27 modules parse (the new `skills-rules.mjs` added to
the syntax harness). The sheet preview was given a real trade -- one racial for two social -- and
shows "RACIAL 1 / 13 was 14, SOCIAL 1 / 14 was 12" against a real derived character, with all six
trade buttons at their real rates; the isolated Elemental Dancer render doubles as the check of the
refused state, where all six come back marked spent with their reasons ("Needs 2 unused social
slots; 0 left.").

**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14 -- the trade and sacrifice dialogs, the
2d4 landing on the chosen skill, and the untrained picker, which reads the skill compendium and so
cannot be exercised in a preview harness at all.

### 2026-09-16 — Dual Class Characters, built from the book alone

His Roll20 sheet has no provision for a second class at all: one `classname` field, one stored
title, nothing that could hold a second class's own progress. This is not a gap in the port to
close against his code -- there is no code -- so the whole feature is read from the Player's
Guide's "Dual Class Characters" (p.45-46) rather than ported.

**A character may hold more than one class item.** `classItems` (`_findItems("class")`) is the
full list; `classItem` stays the first, exactly as before, so every existing reader of a single
class needed no change at all. `identity.isDualClass` is simply `classItems.length > 1`.

**Each class advances on its own title, not the character's.** The book's own worked example
under Experience and Advancement rule 7 settles this on its own: "if a Mage/Warrior advances from
1st to 2nd Title in the Mage class only, he gains his Endurance Title bonus" -- a title that could
move independently per class cannot be one shared number. `title` is now a field on the class item
(`item-class.mjs`), zero meaning "follow the character's own `identity.title`", which is exactly
what a single-classed character does and why nothing about a single class had to be touched.
`_getClassTitle(classItem)` resolves it once and everything downstream uses that.

**Attack skill is the greater of the two charts, each read at its own title.** Experience and
Advancement rule 5: "Attack skill is determined by the greater of the two values." `getBetterAttackSkill`
in `combat-rules.mjs` compares by position in `ATTACK_SKILL_ORDER` (further along wins, not a
bigger number, since these are chart names), with "not on the chart at all" losing to anything
that is and two unknowns returning the first argument rather than erroring. `_prepareCombat` walks
every class in `classItems`, gets each one's chart at that class's own title, and folds them
together with `getBetterAttackSkill`.

**A lore is held if EITHER class has reached it, each at its own title — this is a reading, not a
citation.** The book does not state a rule for lores or the Lore chart directly the way it does for
attack skill. Two things point at the same answer, though: Class Determination rule 5 says the
character "learns the skills of both classes", and Advancement rule 4's stated principle -- "where
two versions of a skill are competitive... the better of the two values are applied" -- is exactly
what rule 5 already does for the attack chart it is built from. `_getBestClassTitle(field)` applies
that principle uniformly to `loreAttackTitle`, `weaponLoreTitle`, `missileLoreTitle`,
`projectileLoreTitle`, `secondWeaponKnowTitle`, `secondWeaponLoreTitle` and `multiMissileLoreTitle`:
each class is tested against its own title, the character holds the thing if any class has reached
its own threshold, and the reported "when" is the threshold that actually granted it (or the
lowest one not yet reached, so the sheet can say what is still to come rather than a bare zero
that would read as "never"). This is flagged as a reading rather than a rule because a future
session should feel free to revisit it if the developer says otherwise.

**Class skill slot requirements are summed across both classes, not maxed.** This is the book's own
stated motivation for the slot tricks existing at all -- "a dual classed character will need to
have many class skill slots" -- which only makes sense if both progressions draw on the same one
Knowledge allowance rather than each getting its own. `identity.classSlotsNeeded` sums
`skillSlotsNeeded` across `classItems`.

**Requirements are reported, never enforced.** The book's own Requirements section: Knowledge 15
minimum, both classes' attribute minimums, and "the decision must be supported by the Game
Master." Refusing the combination outright would be inventing an authority the book explicitly
gives to a person, not a rule -- so `_getDualClassIssues()` lists what falls short (on a
single-classed character it is always empty and costs nothing) and the header shows it in the
alarm colour, exactly the same posture `dualClassIssues`'s sibling `skillSlots.classOver` already
takes toward over-allocation.

**The racial half of the requirement cannot be checked at all, and that is recorded rather than
faked.** Requirements rule 2 is "must meet racial requirements for both classes," but nothing in
his extracted data maps a race to which classes it may take -- the book's "Classes Available by
Race" tables (p.64 onward) were never brought across in any prior pass. Rather than invent a
mapping or silently skip the rule, `_getDualClassIssues` checks only attributes and Knowledge, and
the comment on it says exactly why the racial check is absent, so a future pass extracting those
tables has a clear seam to land in rather than a silent gap to rediscover.

**The header shows both classes once there is more than one**, each with a stepper pair (plus one
title, minus one title) rather than a typed number, because a class's title needs to move in whole
steps and a stepper cannot be typed into the wrong shape. A single-classed character's header is
byte-for-byte what it always rendered.

**Verified:** derivation 251 (24 new: single-class parity, naming, per-class titles, the attack
chart picking the better chart at the right title, a lore granted by either class, a lore a class
has not yet reached still reporting its threshold, slot requirements summing, and the requirement
report on both a qualifying and a falling-short dual-classed character), combat 352 (7 new, on
`getBetterAttackSkill` alone), creature 139 and availability 39 unchanged, 27 modules parse. Sheet
preview given a real second class (Mage at title 4, beside the Warrior at title 12) shows
"Warrior/Mage" and both per-class title rows against real derived data.

**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14 -- the title stepper buttons writing
`system.title` back to the class item and the header re-rendering from it.

### 2026-09-16 — Multiple missile fire, and two places the books argue with themselves

The last of the lore family. Firing more than one missile at a time, and the two skills that pay
the penalty for it down or remove it outright.

**The penalties are the same in both sources, so nothing had to be chosen.** Player's Guide,
"Unconventional Attacks" (p.182), gives two projectiles -4 to hit and -6 damage, three -8 and -12,
and firing two weapons at once -4 to hit; his three situational checkboxes carry exactly those
figures (sheet-worker.js:73015-73017). `MULTI_MISSILE_MODES` holds all three with their shot
counts.

**Both skills are learned one combination at a time, which is what makes them unlike the other
three lores.** Weapon, Missile and Projectile Lore all name weapons singled out for a LARGER bonus,
and holding the lore at all comes from the class. These do not work that way: "A skill roll is
required to learn each particular combination of missile weapon type and projectile type... if the
skill user goes and gets her arrows barbed she will have to reroll" (Master's Manual). So an entry
in the list is what makes the skill apply at all, and the character model carries two new string
lists (`multiMissileKnowList` / `multiMissileLoreList`) in his own "Launcher/Missile" shape, with
"Thrown" as the launcher for a weapon thrown from the hand.

**Matching a combination to the weapon in hand takes either half of the pair.** A character firing
a Long Bow and a character holding the Arrow it fires are both covered by "Long Bow/Arrow". A pair
whose halves do not actually belong together covers neither half, which is what stops a mistyped
combination from applying to every bow in the game. Two of his five match branches
(sheet-worker.js:64699-64703) are for a launcher loaded with something other than its normal
ammunition -- his `switchedProjectiles` path -- and nothing in this port switches a launcher's
ammunition yet, so those two are deliberately not ported rather than half-built.

**The tiers do not stack and Lore is tested first**, exactly as the off-hand skills resolve: Lore
removes the penalty entirely for a learned combination, Knowledge buys it down, neither pays full.
Knowledge's step is `chance / 25` -- the only buy-down in the system that is not 20 -- worth 1 to
hit and 2 damage per level, capped at the penalty so it can cancel but never turn into a bonus.
Both the Master's Manual's text and his code say 25, so it is implemented rather than normalised;
noted for him in `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 29.

**Two projectiles are ONE roll in this port, because his sheet says so and the book says
otherwise.** The Player's Guide says "Roll each attack separately" (p.182). His
`handlePhysicalAttacks` makes one attack roll and reports that the others land for the same damage
again (sheet-worker.js:65168-65187, "2nd projectile hits the same target for the same damage").
These genuinely differ at the table -- separate rolls let one arrow hit and the other miss, in
different body areas -- and the standing rule is that where the sheet and a book disagree the sheet
wins, so the port multiplies: a hit does its damage times the number of projectiles, shown on the
card as "23 each x 2 projectiles". `resolveMultiMissile` reports `shots` and `repeats`, so if he
says the book's version is what he plays, the attack path loops rather than multiplies and nothing
else moves. Written up as `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 28.

**Firing two WEAPONS does not repeat.** Those are two separate attacks, each rolled through the
normal path on its own, so only the projectile modes carry `repeats`. The -4 is also independent of
the off-hand penalty -- "both hands suffer a -4 penalty to hit (ambidextrous or not) in addition to
the normal off-hand weapon penalties" -- and the parenthesis is the point: an Ambidextrous
character escapes the off-hand penalty and does not escape this one, which is why the multi-missile
rules know nothing about handedness and the two are simply added.

**The book's own worked example for Knowledge is wrong**, and the port implements the rule rather
than the example. "At 50% skill chance the practitioner could have no penalties to hit or damage
when firing two arrows at once" -- but two levels off -4/-6 leaves -2/-2, and only 100% clears it.
His sheet implements the rule; so does this. `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 29 carries the arithmetic.

**Not built, and deliberately:** the third thing both skills cover is "penalties for special
projectile types" (barbed arrows and the like). That is its own subsystem -- his
`switchedProjectiles` / `altProjectileName` path -- and nothing in the port models a launcher
loaded with anything but its normal ammunition yet, so the two skills reduce the two penalties
that exist here and the third is left for when special projectiles land. The "point blank or short
range only" restriction on double and triple fire is likewise a hint on the dialog rather than a
gate, because the attack flow does not model range at all.

**Verified:** combat 374 (22 new: the three modes' figures, combination parsing and matching from
either half, a mismatched pair covering nothing, all three tiers, the 25% step flooring at 24%, the
cap at zero, three projectiles taking longer to buy down than two, and a high skill on a
combination never learned still paying full), derivation 251, creature 139 and availability 39
unchanged, 27 modules parse. The sheet preview's Archer -- the real class document, at title 12,
which reaches Multiple Missile Lore at 10 -- now shows the two new rows on the Lore panel, and his
Long Bow firing two arrows resolves through the real rules end to end: "Multiple Missiles -2" on
the to-hit line (the -4 bought down two levels by a 50% Knowledge on exactly that combination),
"-2 multiple missiles" in the damage breakdown, and "23 each x 2 projectiles -- knowledge" for 46
total.

**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14 -- the new Firing dropdown on the attack
dialog and the two new list fields writing back.

### 2026-09-17 — The developer answered nine open questions, and three of them changed the port

He worked through the open `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` list. Every answer is recorded against its item;
this is what actually moved.

**Item 16 was not a contradiction — there are two attribute ceilings.** *"25 for normal statistic
upgrades, 27 for magical upgrades. So you can raise it to 25 with stat up rolls, and 27 is the cap
when using magical boosts."* The comment saying 25 and the function setting 27 were each describing
one of a pair, and looking again with that in hand found the other half of it in his code:
`setMagicalAttributeMaximums` (sheet-worker.js:123007) carries a whole title-tiered table the port
had never read — 23 at title 0, 25 at titles 1-10, 27 at 11-15 — which is the Master's Manual's
mundane / mortal / arch-mortal ranges exactly. So the port now has `getMagicalAttributeMax`
beside `getAttributeMax`, **and the ordinary ceiling at title 11 drops from 27 to 25**, which is
the number his own comment always gave. His `setArchMortalAttributesMax` writing 27 into the
*ordinary* maximum is the actual slip; that stays recorded rather than silently agreed with.

Nothing is clamped by the magical ceiling yet. Doing that properly needs modifiers split into
mundane and magical channels the way his sheet splits them (`tmp_mod_str_mundane` against
`tmp_mod_str_magic`, with `setPassedSTRAttribMods` capping each against its own maximum), and the
port has one undifferentiated `permMod`/`tempMod` pair. The figure is derived and carried on every
attribute so the split has something to land on; the split itself is its own pass.

**Item 1, Monk, is fixed — the first time this project has edited his data.** He confirmed the
reading ("sounds like the right fix"), so `column_maps.py` gained a `ROW_REPAIRS` table: a row he
has authorised a repair for, the repair, and the answer that authorised it. Monk's missing fifth
`classMod` slot is inserted at index 15 on load, every repair is printed on every run, and
`classRequirementsAndDetails` now maps 88 rows clean where it mapped 87 and dropped one. Monk's
armour usage reads armour again instead of its weapon list.

**Item 9, the insect thoraxes, likewise.** *"It should be x2."* `body_charts()` now rewrites a
multiplier written without its `x` and reports each one; nine areas across five charts corrected,
exactly the nine the finding predicted. This and Monk are the only two places the extraction
changes what he wrote, both on his explicit confirmation, both reported every run.

**Item 19 was wrong about its own consequence, and the correction is worth more than the finding.**
The seventeen `=>` gates are still a typo, but they are not what stops an early character using a
lore: *"Yes they gain the skill at first but they cannot use the skill because it says 'Cannot be
used non-acquired'. All of the ones that say cannot be used non-acquired cannot be used until they
actually reach the title they are acquired at."* So acquisition and usage are two different gates,
and the port's `hasLore(title, when)` was already testing the one that matters. What this surfaces
instead is a rule the port has not got: **a skill marked "cannot be used non-acquired" is unusable
until its acquisition title**, which is a second per-skill flag to extract from the books beside
`isRestricted` — neither is in his `skilldict`.

**Item 20 is intentional, for a reason no amount of code reading would have found.** *"Endure All
existed as a spell before Obliteration existed as an energy type. It is a level 22 spell, so it
doesn't include Obliteration."* The generated `ENDURED_BY` already matches. Closed.

**Item 10 settles half a question and opens a sharper one.** *"Enhanced X is listed as an ability
but it is flavor. It is why a creature 'might' have a higher stat than its counterpart... The
creature listings are right. The abilities is used to say how they were arrived at."* So creatures
skipping the racial mechanical switch is by design — an ability explains the stat block rather than
modifying it — and the creature row is the right one where the two copies disagree, which is what
the port already keeps. **But his own `calcAllCreatureCaracs` adds +10 Perception for "Enhanced
Perception" anyway**, which would be counting the same thing twice if the listing is already
inclusive. The port copies his addition today and the question is back with him.

**He asked to see the conflicts before ruling on them**, so `tools/extract/report_trait_conflicts.py`
writes `docs/reference/trait-conflicts.md`: the 39 ability and 2 disability rows that differ and
the 40 racial-only rows, canonical-name differences first because those are the ones that can miss
a `case`. Generated rather than pasted, so it stays true as the data moves.

**Items 22 and 26 were our mistake, not his gap.** *"The data is there. I can see it on the sheet
when I try to make a Roll20 character of those types."* The five classes are not missing — the port
looked in one dictionary and concluded absence. He also explained what they are: **GME is not a
class at all** (*"It allows you to select ANY social skills, and any racial skills, 1 at a time to
fill the slots, and they are 0-title non-classed characters"*, and separately, GMEs do not get the
racial title-1 starting bonuses), and **Elementalist, Summoner and Inquisitor split on a choice**
(good against evil) that changes which skills they get — he is happy with either a choice field or
one document per path ("Inquisitor Fanatical Good vs Inquisitor Fanatical Evil"). Both are now real
work items rather than a reported gap.

**Verified:** derivation 258 (7 new on the two ceilings), combat 374, creature 139 and availability
39 unchanged, 27 modules parse. The class documents rebuild at 88 with Monk's fields in their right
columns, and the generated body charts carry nine corrected thorax multipliers.

### 2026-09-18 — The 14 trait conflicts he was asked to rule on are dormant, not blocking

Checked before deciding whether to wait on his answer: neither field the conflicts report asks
about is read by any mechanical code today.

`grep` for `canonicalName` outside `item-trait.mjs` finds only the sheet class copying it onto a
display row (`actor-creature-sheet.mjs:185`) — nothing switches on it. The three substring checks
that DO key off an ability's text (`actor-creature.mjs:409,435,441`, Enhanced Perception/Affinity/
Fortune) match plain `.name`, not `canonicalName`, and they are the creature-side exceptions his
own answer on item 10 called flavor everywhere else. `value1`/`value2` are likewise only ever
copied onto that same display row, never parsed as a number or branched on.

So the 9 canonical-name and 5 value disagreements in `docs/reference/trait-conflicts.md` have
nowhere to matter yet: there is no racial mechanical ability-effects system in the port at all
(no infravision distance, no hide bonus, nothing keyed by an ability's name), which is the
character-side counterpart to what item 10 already found missing on the creature side. The
conflicts are real facts about his data, and the pipeline already has a deterministic answer for
all of them (the creature row wins, per his confirmation) — but a wrong pick among the 14 is
inert today, not a live bug.

**Held rather than chased down now.** Worth his answer before, and only before, a future pass
builds that mechanical system — at which point a wrong canonical name would silently fail to
match its `case` rather than merely being an unread string. No functional impact in the meantime.

### 2026-09-18 — Board audit: three Backlog modules were already built, and one call was never logged

**What was found.** A full read of the board against the code, before starting the Attributes
module, found the same staleness that caught the Skills row and the five-class "gap". Attributes,
Equipment and Races & Classes were all marked Backlog and all substantially built. The attribute
maximum row still described the flat 27 that the 2026-09-17 answers replaced. Three comments, in
`actor-character.mjs`, `imagine-rpg.mjs` and `DATA-MODEL.md`, still said "flat 27", and one said
equipment item types "do not exist yet". All of these are corrected; the board carries the detail.

**The call that was never logged: packs are built at runtime, not compiled.** Commit `cd57036` added
`module/content-importer.mjs`, which builds the nine world compendia from `src/packs/documents/*.json`
inside Foundry, idempotently and matched by name. `system.json` declares `"packs": []` on purpose. The
reason, from the importer's own header: compiling needs Node and Foundry's CLI, while a runtime
import lets whoever runs the game refresh content from inside Foundry when he sends a corrected
sheet, which matters while his game is still changing. It is recorded here because it decides
where content lives, and the board still described the compile step it replaced.

**Process note, since this is the third time.** Before starting any row marked Backlog, grep the
code for it first. The board has tended to lag behind work done under a neighbouring row: movement
under Races & Classes, the load limit under combat, the importer under content extraction.

### 2026-09-18 — The Intelligence language allowance, and slots handed out by use

**Decision:** `_prepareLanguages` derives `languageAllowance` from the Intelligence table, and the
description tab shows it as his own slot labels with flags for anything past the allowance. Done
on Opus at the user's direction. This closes the Attributes module.

**What his code says.** `setLangSheet(int_final)` (sheet-worker.js:49228) runs at character
creation, and `setUpdateLanguageSheet` (50561) runs from the Update Languages step on the
character's *current* `intelligence`. Each is a 31-case switch writing up to ten labelled slots.
The two switches were compared case by case for every rating from 0 to 30, and they agree. Every
case follows one rule, and it reads straight off the `spokenLanguages`/`writtenLanguages` columns
already in `ATTRIBUTE_TABLES.int`:
- 0: no language at all. His label is "None".
- Below 1: one language, partly spoken ("Speaks(quarter):", "(third)", "(two-thirds)").
- 1 or more: the spoken figure rounded up gives the slot count. The first `floor(written)` slots
  also write, and a fraction of writing lands on the next slot ("Speaks/third writes:").

**Sub-decisions:**
- *The rule is stated in code and his 31 cases are held in the test.* `getLanguageSlotLabels`
  implements the rule. `derive-test.html` carries his labels for every rating, transcribed from his
  switch, and checks the function against all 31. So a table that is already data is not copied a
  second time, but every one of his cases is still verified.
- *A fraction is partial command of one language*, never a share of a second. His one-slot labels
  say so, and so does the Player's Guide ("1/3 ... the most basic vocabulary"). The tab used to
  print "Intelligence allows 0.25 spoken", which read the other way; it no longer does.
- *It follows current Intelligence*, because his update step reads the current attribute, and the
  book defines the figures from Intelligence "after all modifications".
- *An empty row is a slot.* The Player's Guide lets a character "leave any number of language
  slots open for future learning". A blank row is exactly that, so it counts.
- *Flag, never refuse or remove.* This is the same call made for skill slots and for switched-off
  content. A character whose Intelligence drops keeps their languages, and the rows past the
  allowance are marked.
- *Slots are handed out by use, not by position.* His slots were fixed rows, with the name typed
  beside a printed label. Here a language is a row with its own speak and write boxes, in any
  order. Assigning labels by position put a written language beside "Speaks:" and an unwritten one
  on "Speaks/writes:". That happened in the first preview render and is why this changed.
  `assignLanguageSlots` fills the writing slots with written languages first, then gives the rest
  the speaking slots, then any writing slot left over. That order is the book's own: "a character
  can use a written slot for a spoken slot, but not vice versa." It is worked out on the model and
  only merged in by the sheet. So the sheet preview's copy of the private row builder is one line
  and has nothing to drift out of step with.

**Not built, and asked instead (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 30):** Language Lore doubling spoken
languages, and sacrificing racial skill slots for languages. Both are in the Player's Guide and
neither is anywhere in his code. Unlike dual classing, where his sheet had nothing at all, here his
sheet does compute the number and simply leaves them out. So the port follows it until he says
otherwise.

**Verified:** derivation 275 (17 new), combat 374, creature 139 and availability 39 unchanged, 27
modules parse. The description tab was checked in `tools/sheet-preview.html` against the real
derived character at Intelligence 18. That character was given five languages, three written, so
the open slot, the over-allowance row and the writing-over flag all actually render.
**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14.

### 2026-09-18 — Encumbrance: his calcEncumbrance ported whole, and the book's movement penalty beside it

**What was expected:** the Equipment row said the one gap was "the movement penalty for each band,
not yet read out of his code". **What his code says:** there is none. `calcEncumbrance`
(sheet-worker.js:81745) sets `encumbrance_status`, and nothing reads it but its label. But the
same function does three things the port was missing, and all of them move a character between
bands:
- **Armour and general gear are scaled by the being's size** before the bands are read. A ladder
  of height brackets, then weight within each, runs from x.005 under a foot to x10 past 40,000 lb.
  Six to seven feet is the standard. Weapons are exempt: "there are different weapon versions for
  different sized beings already". The preview's 5'9", 215 lb Warrior now carries gear at x.9.
- **A magical plus lightens the item**, from x.9 at +1 to x.05 at +10. It applies to armour and
  weapons, the two item types that carry `magicBonus`.
- **His band labels**: "Not encumbered / Slightly encumbered / Encumbered / Heavily encumbered /
  Over weight(cannot move)". The port had invented "Unencumbered / Slight / Moderate / Heavy /
  Overloaded". Renamed, because the sheet wins.

**Decision:** one pure `resolveEncumbrance` in `combat-rules.mjs`, called by both actor models.
His one function serves both of his sheets, so the port's two copies became one. The movement
penalty comes from the Player's Guide (Encumbrance Table, p.38: 3/4, 1/2, and 1/4 with no
running). It is shown as `movement.loaded`, **beside** his unencumbered rates, never over them.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *Beside, not over.* His sheet shows unencumbered rates and nothing else. Replacing them would
  quietly change a number his table relies on. Showing the loaded rates next to them, only when
  the load costs something, gives the book's answer without hiding his. Whether the loaded rates
  should simply *be* the rates is `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 31.
- *Special movement is not slowed.* The book gives flying its own encumbrance rules, as gliding
  ratios, which are not a speed factor. Scaling a flight rate by 1/2 would invent a rule.
- *Height 0 means not entered.* His ladder would read it as "under a foot" and shrink the load
  to a hundredth. His character creation always sets a height, and a Foundry actor starts at 0.
- *His unreachable branch is not invented.* Under a foot, `<21` is tested before `<20`, so his
  x.0075 case never runs. The port reproduces what runs.

**Not ported, each needing something the port lacks:** quality tags ([Shoddy] x1.75 through
[Master] x.75) and [Float] items weighing nothing. Both need a field on the item, and both are in
the Sonnet note. Also not ported: Lighten Load, Spirit of the Donkey and the temporary
weight/capacity modifiers, which are magic items in the deferred magic phase. The book's fatigue
multipliers are not ported, as there is no fatigue system.

**Verified:** combat 406 (32 new, covering every size bracket boundary tested, the plus table,
the labels and factors, the book's own worked warrior, and the loaded rates), derivation 280 (5
new), creature 140 (1 new: a creature's gear scales by its size too), availability 39, 27 modules
parse. In `tools/sheet-preview.html`, the main Warrior reads "Not encumbered, 64.8 / 387 lb" with no
loaded table. A new isolated render gives the same derived Warrior two real 100 lb iron bars from
the equipment pack. That reads "Encumbered, 244.8 / 387 lb", and "At current load: 1/2 speed"
shows walk 60 → 30 per ten seconds. This was checked through the page text; the Browser pane was
hidden and screenshots came back blank, so the red styling has not been looked at by eye.
**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14.

### 2026-09-18 — Half races: ported from his code, which turned out to have them

**The user's requirement:** a character must be able to descend from two races. **What was
found:** his sheet has a whole race-type system that the port had missed, because it searched for
`race_list2` while his field is `race2_arwpick`. `race_type` offers One Race, Half Race, Multi
Race(3), Multi Race(4), Part Race and Trace Race (sheet-worker.js:32591-32726). **Only Half Race
is implemented.** `applyRaceToAttribs` (32966) returns "not yet implemented" for the other four.

**Decision:** Half Race is ported from `applyHalfRaceToAttribs` (33770) into a new pure module,
`module/race-rules.mjs`. A character may hold two race items. The model's `raceItem` becomes a
stand-in `{ name, system }` holding the combined race, so every existing `raceItem.system` read
gets half-race values without knowing it. `raceItems` is always the real items.

**How the two combine**, each from a named place in his code: the numbers use his
`averageTwoFloatsRounded`. That covers the attribute mods, attribute maximums, starting Endurance
modifier, characteristic mods, resistance mods, speed multiplier, walk/jog/run mods and jumps.
Endurance formulas are kept as his "first|second" pair. Special movement and body type come from
the first race; swimming is allowed if either race can swim; a half race is never formless. The
name is his `full_race_name`, "first|second".

**`averageTwoFloatsRounded` is the book's rule, not a plain average.** A modifier only one race has
is taken whole, two bonuses average rounding up, two penalties average rounding towards the bigger
penalty, and a bonus against a penalty is added. That is the Player's Guide's Half Race rule 1
exactly, so here his code and the book agree.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *A stand-in rather than a rewrite.* Eight places read `raceItem.system`. Routing them all
  through a new accessor would touch every one; handing them a combined object of the same shape
  touches none. The cost is that `raceItem` is not a document when there are two races. Only the
  character model ever reads it, which was checked.
- *Order matters, and it is the order the items were added.* The first race is the one whose body
  and special movement a half race keeps, as in his code.
- *A third race is reported, not dropped.* His Multi Race is unimplemented, so there is no rule of
  his to follow. The first two combine, and the header names the ones ignored.
- *Not applied:* the book's -5 Social Class for mixed races, which his code does not apply either,
  and the breeding table, which the book leaves to the Game Master. Both are asked in
  `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 32.
- *Two title-Endurance numbers keep the first race's value* (`titleMax`, `titleMod`), because the
  schema holds one number where he holds a pair. Nothing reads them yet. His pair is kept whole in
  the formula fields beside them.

**Not yet combined, because the race item does not carry them yet:** racial skills, racial
abilities/disabilities/immunities, ages and class eligibility. His half race merges all four, and
they are the next part of finishing Races & Classes.

**Verified:** derivation 304 (24 new: every branch of the helper, a two-race combination field by
field, and a character built from two races), combat 406, creature 140, availability 39; 28 modules
parse, `race-rules.mjs` newly added to the syntax check's list. In `tools/sheet-preview.html` the
real Warrior, re-derived as Human(Civilized:Village)|Elf(High), reads "Half Race
Human(Civilized:Village)|Elf(High)" with Strength 18 and Agility 20 from ratings of 19 and 18.
**Not verified:** a second race being dropped onto a character in a running Foundry V14.

### 2026-09-18 — The trait conflicts are ruled on: creature is always right

He answered the conflicts report. Canonical names: *"Creature is always right... though they share
similar names, when applied to creatures they are slightly different. The racial ability list and
creature ability lists are not 100% identical."* Values: *"The creature values are right. I don't
know what Racial value 30 or 50 means. Enhanced Taste doesn't do a whole heck of a lot on a
creature, thus the no value."*

**Nothing changes in the build** — the pipeline already keeps the creature row on every conflict, so
all 14 decisions land where they already were. What changes is the reading of the data: the two
copies are *deliberately* different (one name, slightly different meaning per actor type), not two
drifted copies of one truth. That is also why a shared trait document is a simplification worth
watching: a future racial mechanical-effects system should not assume a creature ability row
describes what a race's ability of the same name does. The racial `Enhanced Taste` 30/50 is
unexplained and is left out; racial-only rows still stay available for characters.

Open from item 10 and untouched by this: whether his `calcAllCreatureCaracs` +10 for "Enhanced
Perception" double-counts a stat block that already includes it.

### 2026-09-18 — The rest of a race: skills, abilities, ages, fertility and which classes it can take

**Decision:** the race and class documents now carry everything his half-race code merges, and
the class eligibility check the board wrongly called "book-only". All of it is generated from his
tables, never hand-typed:

| field | from his | onto |
|---|---|---|
| `racialSkills` (name + bonus), `racialSkillNote` | `raceSkillDetailValues` (getRaceSkillDetails, 51856) | race |
| `abilities`, `disabilities`, `immunities` | `raceFeatureAbilities` (getRacialFeatureAbilities, 45588) | race |
| `fertileWith` | `racefertiledict` (32833), the list his Half Race picker offers | race |
| `ages` (startLow, startHigh, maxAge) | the `getAge` switch (38995), walked by a new `race_ages()` | race |
| `blockedRaces` | `classRaceAndDetails` (51088), read by setClassDetails | class |

**How a half race combines them** (`race-rules.mjs`): racial skills from both, each once, with a
shared skill at the better bonus. Abilities and the other two lists are merged with duplicates
removed. Ages take the lesser of the two, and "Immortal" counts as longer than any number. A class
is barred only if **both** races are barred, as his `setClassDetails` has it.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *Barred-races, not allowed-races.* `classRaceAndDetails` lists the races that may NOT take a
  class. Warrior's list is empty, meaning anyone can be a Warrior. Reading it the other way round
  would have closed Warrior to every race.
- *Reported, never refused.* His sheet lets a barred class be overridden ("is usually not this
  class. This was overriden!"), and on his sheet an infertile pair simply cannot be picked. The port
  has no picker, so both show as flags on the header, `identity.raceIssues`, the same way dual-class
  requirements are shown.
- *His two slips are not reproduced.* `getBestModifierPercent` declares both its parameters with
  one name, so a shared skill always gets the second race's bonus; the port keeps the better one.
  `lesserOfTwoNumbers` compares "Immortal" as NaN and falls through to the first value; the port
  treats a word as longer than any number. Both are in `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 32.
- *Listed, not applied.* Abilities are names his trait compendia describe. The mechanics behind them
  (his `setTempRacialAbilities` switch) are still unported, and so is the racial-skill picker. His
  "keep only the stronger version of an ability" and "drop abilities the body cannot use" steps are
  left out too, since they only matter once the lists do something.
- *The Description tab gains a Race panel*, showing the effective race: starting-age range, maximum
  age, racial skill options with bonuses, abilities, disabilities, immunities.
- *Not carried:* his "(Slight Physique)" variants of a few races, since the port has no
  slight-physique option. Also Gremlin and Changeling racial skills: his code writes Gremlin's
  inline, as it does the Fairies', and Changeling has a table of its own. Both are in the Sonnet
  note.

**Also corrected:** the dual-class code said "the racial half cannot be checked". It can now, for
every character and not only dual-classed ones.

**Verified:** `build_documents.py --check` is clean apart from the two missing racial-skill rows
above. Every race has ages and every class has a blocked-races entry. Derivation 320 (16 new),
combat 406, creature 140, availability 39, 28 modules parse. In `tools/sheet-preview.html`, the
real Human(Civilized:Village)|Elf(High) Warrior/Mage shows no race issues, a Race panel with
Listen at the Elf's +20% rather than the Human's +10%, Detect Magic and Sing from the Elf, and the
Human's ages (18–24, maximum 100, not the Elf's 1000).

### 2026-09-18 — Every class's skills by title, class paths as documents, and GME

**What was found.** His `setClassSkillLists` (sheet-worker.js:57903-62868) carries **every class's
class skills, title by title**: the slot, the title a skill arrives at, whether it is CORE, and 82
conditional lines. The port had said his data held no per-title skills because `classtitledict`
does not, and only Elemental Dancer showed any (hand-authored from a Word template). Also found:
`checkClassQualification` answers five classes from **inline rows** before it ever reaches his
class dictionary (Elemental Dancer, Elementalist, Summoner, Inquisitor, GME). They have the
dictionary's 22 columns, and that is why those five first looked missing.

**Decision:**
- *Generated, as everything else is.* `class_skill_lists()` walks the switch, tracking the if-chains
  around each line. `special_class_rows()` parses the five inline rows, named by the dictionary's
  own column map. 92 classes, 4,360 skill lines.
- *A class with a choice is one document per path*, the user's call over a choice field. Each path
  resolves its own skill list and its alignment (his `getAlignRequirements`). The paths are
  Elemental Dancer x6 (element), Elementalist and Summoner x2 (Call of Life/Death), Innominate x2
  (Detect Evil/Good), Inquisitor x2 (Bless/Blasphemy), and Knight and Knight(Dark) x2
  (Standard/Templar). They are named in his parenthesised style: "Elementalist(Call of Death)",
  "Inquisitor(Bless)". The Knights' Standard keeps the plain name, since nothing in his data names
  it, and the dark one's other variant is "Knight(Dark Templar)", his own wording. `baseClass`
  and `path` on the class item record what his tables key by and which choice this is.
- *A race that cannot cast keeps both options.* 24 slots across 24 casting classes give such a race
  a different skill. That depends on the character's race, not the class, so each entry is marked
  `requires: "caster"` or `"nonCaster"`. The per-title text shows it as "Scroll Knowledge
  (no-casting races: Hermetic Lore)". Picking the right one belongs to character generation.
- *GME is a class document flagged `nonClassed`*, because his sheet offers it in the class list.
  Three of his GME rules now apply:
  - It fights on a chart picked outright: a new `combat.chosenAttackSkill`, Beginner by default,
    with a dropdown on the Combat tab. This is his `gme_all_attack_skills_select`.
  - It has no racial first-title Endurance bonus ("GMEs (0 title) get no 1st title endurance
    modifier", 8142).
  - It has no class skills.
  His other GME rules are already true of the port or belong to character generation: title 0,
  no class slots, and any racial or social skill.
- *His two slips are not reproduced* (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 33). Innominate's second alignment
  branch retests "Detect Evil", and the Knight variant select is never shown.
- *The hand-authored Elemental Dancer is now redundant*, since his data builds it, and the pipeline
  reports it as such. Under the standing rule, his code wins over the Word template.

**Effect on content:** 88 class documents become 103. "Elemental Dancer", "Innominate" and the
unsplit Elementalist-type classes are replaced by their paths. The runtime importer matches by
name, so an old document in an existing world's compendium stays until removed. An availability
override keyed `class:Elementalist` does not reach the paths, so each path is its own key.

**Verified:** `build_documents.py --check` shows no class issues except the now-redundant manual
entry. Derivation 325 (5 new, GME), combat 406, creature 140, availability 39, 28 modules parse.
The combat suite's "every class parses to a real chart" check now skips a non-classed class,
whose bare "Beginner" is meant not to parse. In the preview, the real Warrior's Skills tab now shows
its progression from his data, and Elemental Dancer(Water) at title 7 shows "Balanced Mind, Call of
Water, Elemental Knowledge, Mind Dance, Kinetics Lore".

### 2026-09-19 — A method of adding content to every pack, with no code change

**The user's requirement:** "leave a method of adding new content to every module." **What existed:**
one hand-authored file, `src/packs/manual/classes.json`, read by a classes-only loader, holding one
entry that his data now builds anyway (Elemental Dancer). The in-Foundry route was also undocumented.
That matters because the runtime importer updates the system's compendiums **by name**, so a Game
Master who edited a stock entry would lose the edit at the next re-import.

**Decision: two routes, both documented in `docs/ADDING-CONTENT.md`.**

1. **In Foundry**, for a Game Master's own table. Create items in a compendium of your own, set the
   Sourcebook field, and drag them on. No code was needed for this route to be sound: the Content
   Availability window already discovers sourcebooks from *every* Item compendium
   (`#discoverSourcebooks`), so any name a Game Master tags content with ("Custom", "Our Campaign")
   becomes a switch by itself. The guide is plain about the one trap: stock entries are overwritten
   on re-import, so change a copy under a new name and forbid the original.
2. **In the content files**, for content that ships with the system. There is one
   `src/packs/manual/<pack>.json` per pack, all nine, each with a worked `_example`, merged by one
   shared `apply_manual_content` in `build_documents.py`. It replaces `load_manual_classes`.

**Sub-decisions on route 2:**
- *Additive by default; overriding his data must be said.* A name his data already builds is
  ignored and reported, unless the entry carries `"_override": true`. In that case only the given
  fields are laid over his (objects merge, lists replace) and the override is reported on **every**
  build. His sheet is the source of truth, so a silent override would contradict the project's
  first rule. A loud one is a correction he can see.
- *Hand content defaults to sourcebook "Custom"*, so all of it sits under one switch unless tagged
  otherwise. That is the "tagged by sourcebook, custom content supported" architecture from
  2026-09-10, finally with a default.
- *A misspelt field is reported*, checked against every name the item type's schema file declares
  plus every key the generated documents carry. It is a flat name set, not a tree, because the schemas
  build some fields through helper functions. A typo is almost never another field's real name, so
  the flat check catches what matters. Without it, a misspelt field would vanish silently on import.
- *A base class with paths cannot be overridden whole.* Each path is its own document, so each is
  overridden by its own name.
- *The Elemental Dancer entry is removed* from `manual/classes.json`, since his data builds it. A
  `_history` note in the file says why, so the file does not look as though content went missing.

**Verified:** with every example moved into `entries`, plus a deliberate typo and two collisions,
the build reported 8 added (all tagged Custom), 1 override (Climb's description only), 3 ignored
(one of them a collision in my own first example, Rope Use, which is a real skill of his and was
renamed Knot Craft), and the typo "damge". With the files as shipped (no entries), the generated
documents are byte-identical to before. The JavaScript suites are untouched by a build-tool change.
**Not verified:** route 1 in a running Foundry V14.

### 2026-09-19 — The character generator, from his nine creation steps

**Decision:** a step-by-step generator window, built on his own character creation. His sheet runs
creation as nine numbered, confirmed steps (race, attributes, racial features, handedness and
languages, class, skills, alignment, money and equipment, name; sheet-worker.js:4480-7963). The
generator covers them in seven: Basics, Race, Attributes, Class, Skills, Details, Review. It
creates the actor with its race, class and skill items in one go. It opens from a **Create
Character** button in the Actors directory, or from `game.imagine.generateCharacter()`.

**Three layers, so that almost all of it is tested outside Foundry:**
- `module/chargen-rules.mjs`: the rules, pure, with dice passed in. `assembleCharacter` turns
  the finished choices into `{ actor, items, issues }`.
- `module/chargen-view.mjs`: what each step shows and whether it is finished, also pure.
- `module/apps/character-generator.mjs`: only the Foundry face. It reads the form, rolls through
  `CONFIG.Dice.randomUniform`, loads the compendiums, and calls `Actor.create`.

The preview (`tools/chargen-preview.html`) calls the same view builder the window calls. So it
renders what the window renders, not a hand-kept copy of it. That is the lesson of the preview's
two earlier drifts, where a duplicated private builder silently fell out of step.

**The rules, each from a named place in his code:**
- *Attribute dice are per attribute, not per method* (his three rolling buttons, 4613/4711/4881):
  STR, AGL, VIT and AUR use 7d4 keeping 5; INT, WIS, KNW, APP, CHM and PTY use 6d4 keeping 5;
  SOC and WIL use 5d4. The methods differ only in the number of sets, keeping the best of each
  attribute: Adventurer 1, Heroic 2, Legendary 3.
- *Normal is the book's* (5d4 for everything, 2:1). His sheet has no button for it and does not
  contradict it, the same footing dual classing was built on. It is labelled "not on his sheet" in
  the type list.
- *Swaps* are his "3-1 Attribute Adjustment": three points taken to add one, or two for Normal.
  Social Class is never moved, and nothing may drop below 5. The minimum is the book's; his code
  only floors at 0 but does not contradict it.
- *Civilized Humans* get three +1 points (which may stack, never on Social Class) and six
  one-point moves. A half race with a Civilized Human parent gets the points but not the moves:
  his `setExtraRaceSheets`, and the book agrees.
- *Slight physique* (female) is -1 STR, +1 AGL. His sheet folds it into the racial modifier; the
  port has no physique field, so it lands in the stored rating. The numbers are the same.
- *The stored rating is roll + physique + swaps + human points.* Racial modifiers and limits are
  NOT added. The character model adds them, exactly as his `calcFinals` adds `race_mod` to
  `best_roll`. The preview proves the two agree: for all twelve attributes, the generator's
  "final" equals what the character model derives for the created character.
- *Class qualification* compares the class's attribute requirements with the final attributes,
  and checks barred races (both, for a half race). It reports, and has an override tick box, as
  his sheet's `override_race_restriction` does.
- *Starting class skills* are the class's title-1 skills. The no-casting alternative is used for
  a race with the disability "Cannot Cast Spells", which is his `nocast`.
- *Starting skill bonuses*, rolled once at creation:
  - A class skill gets its dice, plus 30 if core, plus every class modifier naming its type
    ("+10% to magical skills" on a Magical skill). This is his `setClassSkillAbility`.
  - A racial skill's dice count double, plus the race's bonus (his `setRacialSkillAbility`,
    "tmprandom*2").
  - A social skill gets its dice.
  The roll is `startingBonus`; the fixed part is `abilityBonus`.
- *Handedness* is his `determineHandedness`: an Ambidextrous race always is; otherwise d100 gives
  1-75 Right, 76-95 Left, 96-100 Ambidextrous.
- *GME* is title 0, has no class skills, may take any race's racial skills, and picks its attack
  chart.

**Sub-decisions:**
- *The second race offers only fertile partners*, as his Half Race picker does
  (`racefertiledict`). An infertile pair cannot be made here at all. Dropping race items on a
  sheet by hand still can, and is flagged there.
- *Selects, checkboxes and numbers redraw at once; text is read when a button is pressed*, so
  typing is never interrupted. "Next" always works and says why a step is not finished, rather
  than sitting disabled with no explanation.
- *Every per-character skill field is set outright* (`misc`, `isCommon`), not left to schema
  defaults. The compendium copy carries none of them, and the preview showed a skill missing
  `misc` working out as NaN.
- *The attribute rolls go to chat*, as his rolling buttons post theirs.

**Not built yet, and why** (`docs/sonnet/2026-09-19-character-generator.md`):
- His height/frame/weight tables, and the hair, eye and skin colour tables. These are entered by
  hand for now.
- Starting money by social class.
- Buying equipment.
- The social-class and cross-skill modifiers on skills (`getExtraClassRacialMods`,
  `getSocialSkillMods`).
- The special races with their own creation rules: Changeling, Formless, Famorian's evokes.
- Slot trades during creation. They exist on the sheet afterwards.

**Also found:** eight skills write their starting dice "dl0" (a lower-case L for the 1 of "d10");
the dice reader takes them as d10 (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 34).

**Verified:** the new `tools/chargen-test.html` passes 46 of 46. Derivation 325, combat 406, creature
140 and availability 39 are unchanged, and 31 modules parse. `tools/chargen-preview.html` walks
every step with real content. It makes a Heroic, female, half Human(Civilized:Village)|Elf(High)
Mage who correctly fails the Mage's Will Force 14 and takes the override. Created, she derives
exactly the attributes the generator showed. Her class skills carry his bonuses (Detect Magic
30 core + 10 magical), her languages fit her allowance, and she is not encumbered.
**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14. That covers the window itself, the
directory button, reading the form, `Actor.create` with embedded items, and the chat card.

### 2026-09-19 — Finishing classes: skills granted by title, the title gate, and path-aware switches

**The ask:** "time to finish classes." Four things were left on the Races & Classes row that belong
to the class half. The race half's leftovers (Gaunt, the racial ability *mechanics*, Multi/Part/Trace
Race) are all waiting on the developer, so they stay where they are.

**What his sheet actually does, found by reading it rather than assuming.**
`setClassSkillLists` (sheet-worker.js:57903) gives a class its whole progression at once, each skill
tagged with the title it arrives at, and `setFinalClassSkills` (63177) writes **all fifteen titles**
onto the sheet at creation. Only the first title's skills get a live ability and chance; every later
title's are written with `_ability`=0 and `_chance`=0 (63292 onward). They are on the sheet, and they
do not work yet. A later title's skills come alive on reaching that title: `handleLevelTitle` (66058)
asks `getTitleToAcquireSkillsByGoal` (92462) which title a goal buys, and its answer is the plain
title boundary — goal 0 → title 1, 3 → 2, up to 42 → 15. **Reaching title N is exactly when title N's
skills are acquired**, so granting on the title is his rule and not a simplification of it.

**Decisions:**
- *Class skills are granted automatically on reaching the title* (the user's call, asked this pass).
  `module/class-advancement.mjs` watches the character's title, a dual-classed character's per-class
  title, and a class arriving on an actor, and creates every entitled skill the character does not
  already hold. Bonuses come from the same `getClassSkillBonuses` character generation uses, so a
  skill granted at title 7 is built exactly like one the character started with.
- *A grant never takes anything away.* It never removes a skill, never touches one already held
  (whoever added it), and never grants past the class's own list. A skill the campaign's switches
  disallow is skipped and named, not forced on: the Game Master turned it off deliberately.
- *Slots are not policed by the grant.* His own sheet marks the excess "REMOVED" rather than refusing
  the title, and the slot panel already reports an overrun.
- *A class skill above the character's title is refused on the roll*, not hidden — his
  `handleHighTitleClassSkillRoll` (64169), "this skill cannot be used before <name> title", by title
  NAME. This also closes the second of the two per-skill flags left open on the Skills row (his
  2026-09-17 answer on item 19, "cannot be used non-acquired"): `acquiredAtTitle` was already on the
  skill schema and read by nothing. It is read now.
- *A class's armour and weapon usage are shown, never enforced.* His sheet carries both as text and
  displays them (51018-51019, 51297-51298) and never compares them against what the character wears.
  Deciding whether a suit is "Leather or less" would mean inventing a comparison he does not make,
  against strings in 40-odd shapes; the Player's Guide's cost for breaking the rule is the Game
  Master's to apply. Displayed on the Skills tab beside the progression.
- *An availability override on a base class covers its paths* (the user's call). A class with a
  choice is one document per path, so forbidding `class:Elementalist` would otherwise forbid nothing
  at all, six documents being named something else. `getOverrideKeys` returns the path's own key
  first and the base class's second, so one path can still be allowed out of a class otherwise
  switched off. The base class comes from the document's `baseClass` field, or the name before the
  bracket for a path a Game Master authored by hand.

**Corrected:** the sheet's class-progression panel read `advancement.classSkills`, the per-title
text, and carried a comment saying his sheet-worker held no per-title skills. It does, and
`classSkillList` is where the extraction puts them, so every class has a progression to show rather
than the handful authored from his Word templates. The panel now shows every title that brings
skills, marks the ones reached, and renders one block per class for a dual-classed character.
`tools/sheet-preview.html` no longer duplicates the panel logic; it calls the real rule.

**Verified:** derivation 347 (22 new), availability 46 (7 new), combat 406, creature 140 and
character generation 46 unchanged; 33 modules parse. The preview renders a real Elemental
Dancer(Water)'s fifteen titles with his own title names and core marks, and its usage line.
**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14 — the three hooks, the grant's
`createEmbeddedDocuments`, the notifications, and the refused roll.

### 2026-09-19 — Experience and levelling: his ladder, his goal rolls, and Arch Mortal

**The ask:** "build the experience and levelling system." His advancement code was the one large
subsystem still entirely unported — the thing that made the class-skill grant built earlier the same
day the *consequence* of a title rising, with nothing to make one rise except typing a number.

**How his ladder works**, from `getNewGoal`, `getNewTitle`, `getExpByGoal` and `getNextGoalExp`.
Experience buys GOALS; three goals make a TITLE (`getTitleByGoal`: title = goal/3 + 1). A goal is the
small step — a chance at an attribute, a handful of skill points. A title is the large one — class
skills, Endurance, attack charts. Below title 1 sit three negative goals, his Zero Title. The ladder
runs from -1,500 to 1,126,000 across 15 titles and 45 goals, and stops there: every deity rung above
it is commented out in his code.

**Tables are generated, never transcribed** (`tools/extract/extract_advancement_tables.py` →
`module/advancement-tables.mjs`). Four of his functions describe the same ladder, so the generator
reads all four and CROSS-CHECKS them, printing every disagreement. That is how the two defects below
were found; a transcription would have copied them in silently.

**Decisions:**
- *The goal ladder comes from `getNewGoal`, not `getExpByGoal`.* His switch writes `case 30:` twice,
  the second where `case 40:` belongs, so goal 40 answers 0 on his sheet (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` 35).
  `getNewGoal` is also the function that actually decides a character's goal, so it wins.
- *Experience is queued, not applied.* His `titles_to_raise` / `goals_to_raise` are ported as they
  are: adding experience works out the new title and goal and queues the steps, and the character
  stays where they are until each is walked. Each step has a decision in it that only a player can
  make, which is the reason his sheet does the same.
- *His three refusals are kept.* Nothing may be added while a level-up is waiting; nothing is added
  from an amount of zero or less; and experience that would carry a character across goal 30 without
  the Arch Mortal qualifications adds NOTHING AT ALL, rather than creeping up to the line. The exp
  cap for the character's CURRENT title trims the rest, and the trim is reported.
- *A step is atomic here, where his is not.* His sheet stores the rolled results and the placed
  points in temporary attributes, so a browser closed mid-goal leaves them half-applied. The window
  rolls, places and commits in one action instead: a window closed early loses nothing, and the goal
  is simply offered again. The QUEUE is stored exactly as his is, so the level-up itself survives
  logging out.
- *A title is taken before the goal that crossed it*, which is his own refusal in `handleGoalCommit`
  ("Commit title before committing goal"). The window shows whichever step is next, so there is no
  wrong order to get into.
- *The Arch Mortal qualification is DERIVED, not stored.* His sheet keeps a Yes/No flag a player
  presses a button to refresh, which goes stale the moment an attribute changes. Here the whole
  screen is worked out on every render from `archmortalqualifylist` — now extracted onto every class
  document (23 columns, mapped from his own column-header comment). The one part that cannot be
  derived is the class's special requirement, a sentence only a Game Master can judge, and that is
  the only piece stored (`identity.archSpecialMet`), settable by a GM alone.
- *A character's powers are Items*, the same `power` type creatures use, rather than his one
  comma-separated field. So the invulnerability granted at 11th, 13th and 15th is a real item, and
  the qualification's "holds any power" is a count of them. Each invulnerability REPLACES the one
  before, as his string-replace does — they never stack.
- *Sense Supernatural is a skill item* set to his ability figure by title (20/40/60/80/99), taken
  from the compendium where the content is imported so it carries its own description.
- *Awards are not built.* The user's call: players enter the experience they were awarded, so his
  `calcCreatureExp` and `handleSplitExp` have nothing to compute here.

**Found in his code and reported** (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` 35 and 36): the duplicate `case 30:`; goal
-2 beginning at -1,000 in one function and -999 in another; and `setNewCharacteristics` overwriting
the summed half-race Endurance with the first parent's alone at titles 11 and 12. The third is
reproduced rather than corrected — the sheet is the source of truth — and is covered by a test that
says so.

**Also fixed:** `identity.titleName` called `getTitleName` on the class ITEM, where it lives on the
class's DATA MODEL, so it would have thrown in Foundry. The preview caught it, because its class is a
real document rather than a fixture carrying the method in both places.

**Verified:** the new `tools/advancement-test.html` passes 77 of 77. Derivation 347, combat 406,
creature 140, character generation 46 and availability 46 are unchanged, and 38 modules parse.
`tools/levelup-preview.html` renders all three steps of the real template against the real view, for
a real Warrior at title 10 standing one award short of the line: the qualification screen names
exactly what he is missing (Sweep 65/75, Weapon Lore 30/65), the gate refuses the experience, 11th
title takes the Endurance formula's maximum rather than rolling it (1d4+1 → +5), the package is
listed before it is applied, and his own title names read through ("Lord" → "Battle Lord").
**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14 — the window itself, its dice, the two
commits, the power and skill creation, and the chat cards.

### 2026-09-19 — Bug-fix pass over the class and levelling work

Both passes of the day were reviewed, once by the window that wrote them and once by a reader given
only the code and no account of what it was meant to do. The second read found more, and worse.
Every fix below carries a test, in `tools/advancement-test.html` or the new `tools/levelup-walk.html`,
so none of them can come back quietly.

**The grant could run twice on one title.** `commitTitle` updated the title and then granted the
class skills itself — and the `updateActor` hook, watching for exactly that change, granted them
again. Both read the character's held skills before either had created anything, so a title that
brings two skills could leave the character holding four, each with its own rolled starting bonus
and each eating a class skill slot. The commit now marks its own update (`GRANT_HANDLED`) and the
hook keeps out of it; the grant also refuses to run twice for one actor at once, since the
compendium read in the middle of it is all the opening a second call needs.

**A successful attribute roll could be thrown away.** The clamp compared the DISPLAYED value, which
carries temporary modifiers, against the maximum, but wrote to the rating. A character under a spell
that lifted Strength to its cap would have the roll silently discarded — the chat card already
announcing "+1 Strength" — and be a point short for good once the spell ended. Room is now measured
against the permanent figure (rating + race + permanent), and a roll that succeeds counts towards
his minimum-increase floor whether or not there was room for it, which is what his handleGoalCommit
counts.

**The Arch Mortal gate now guards the crossing, not the standing.** His sheet stores the
qualification as a flag, so once it reads Yes it stays Yes. This port derives it every render, which
cannot go stale — but it also means it can flip back to No when a Will Force is drained or a power
is lost, and written his way that refused ALL further experience to a 12th-title Arch Mortal. The
gate now applies only to a character below the line who is about to cross it.

**The experience cap could delete experience.** His sheet writes the cap over the total, which takes
experience away from a character already above it — and one can be, since a Game Master may set a
title back by hand. The cap now trims only what is being added, and a character already at or above
it gains nothing and is told why.

**One race gained no Endurance, ever.** Elf(Silver) writes its title formula as a plain "1" rather
than dice, and both dice readers answered 0 for it. A bare number is now read as itself.

**Sense Supernatural could be a downgrade.** An Arch Mortal's figure was assigned rather than
floored, so a character who already held the skill the ordinary way — starting roll, the class's
+30, goal points spent over ten titles — was cut back to 20 on reaching 11th.

**The window promised the wrong ceiling.** It said "every attribute maximum becomes 27", from his
setArchMortalAttributesMax, while the character model enforces the pair he confirmed on 2026-09-16:
25 ordinarily, 27 magically (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 16). It now says what actually happens.

**Smaller ones:** a level-up window with a fixed id would have stolen another character's window, so
it is per character now and its title bar names them; a goal commit with nothing queued would have
written goal 0 over a real goal; skill points are placed before the goal is committed, so a failure
leaves the step repeatable rather than the points gone; a class skill whose title has not come was
gated against a class that might not exist, leaving every such skill unusable on a character whose
class had been removed; a title advance silenced the grant's report and then dropped it, hiding a
skill missing from the compendium or refused by the switches; and a title whose Endurance came out 0
left the Roll button showing as though nothing had happened.

**Verified:** advancement 86 (9 new), the new `tools/levelup-walk.html` 34, derivation 347, combat
406, creature 140, character generation 46 and availability 46, all passing; 38 modules parse. The
walk drives the real writing code against a stub actor that records what it was asked to do, and
covers the bare cases -- no class, no race, no skills -- which each used to be a plausible way to
throw. **Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14, which includes the hook interplay
the first fix is about; the test proves the grant is not called twice by the commit, not that
Foundry's hook behaves as documented.

### 2026-09-19 — Adding gear from the sheet, and a crowbar

**The ask:** a button for adding new inventory, and a crowbar, "even though that was not on the
Roll20 sheet", with reasonable weights.

**Adding gear.** The Equipment tab could only take items dragged from a compendium: nothing on it
made, opened or removed anything. It now carries **Add equipment / Add weapon / Add armour**, and
every row an edit and a remove button. A new item is created carried (not equipped -- a thing just
picked up is in a pack) and its sheet opens at once, because an item called "New Equipment" weighing
nothing is not what anyone wanted. A remove asks first, since the row buttons are small and a
deletion here is final. Dragging from a compendium still works and is still the better route for
anything the system already knows.

**The crowbar goes through the content route, not into his data.** `src/packs/manual/equipment.json`
is the file built for exactly this on 2026-09-19, so the entry lands in the pack on the next build,
is tagged "Custom" automatically, and can be switched off with every other custom entry. Nothing
generated from his dictionaries was touched, which is the rule: his data is his.

**Its weight is anchored to his own figures, not to the real world.** 5 lb, beside his
Pick(Digging) 5, Shovel 6, Tongs(Large) 5 and Grappling Hook 3. A real three-foot wrecking bar is
about that, but the reason to write 5 is that a character carrying his shovel and this crowbar
should feel the same about both. The entry says in its own description that it is not from the
Roll20 sheet and when it was added, so a reader of the pack is never misled about its provenance,
and a note beside it records the anchoring.

**Found while doing it:** every manual file's `_about` promises that "any key starting with `_` is
never read as content", but `apply_manual_content` only honoured that INSIDE a row. A Game Master
who followed the documented convention and left a note beside their entries crashed the build with
`'str' object has no attribute 'items'`. Fixed, and `docs/ADDING-CONTENT.md` now says so and carries
the crowbar as its worked example.

**Verified:** the pack builds 637 equipment documents where it built 636, and the Crowbar reads
weight 5, sourcebook "Custom". `tools/sheet-preview.html` renders all three Add buttons and an edit
and remove button on each of the seven gear rows, with no console errors. Derivation 347,
availability 46 and advancement 86 unchanged; every module parses. **Not verified:** the buttons in
a running Foundry V14 -- creating the item, opening its sheet and the delete confirmation.

### 2026-09-19 — Clearing the hand-off backlog, and three standing answers

Nineteen hand-off notes had accumulated in `docs/sonnet/`. Each was checked against the code as it
stands rather than against its own wording, which found several items already done and two
obsolete. What follows is the part worth keeping: the answers that were being re-asked in note
after note, settled here once so they stop costing anything.

**Strings are not localised, and new ones should not be either.** Five notes asked whether their new
strings should go through `lang/en.json`, each deferring to "what the other tabs do". What the other
tabs do is nothing: `lang/en.json` carries sheet names, tab labels and the twelve attribute names --
exactly what Foundry itself asks for -- and every other string in every template is hardcoded
English. Two `localize` calls exist across eleven templates. So new strings stay hardcoded, matching
the rest; localisation is a single later pass over everything, not a decision taken string by
string. **This supersedes item 4 of `2026-09-18-language-allowance.md`, item 4 of
`2026-09-18-races-classes.md` and the same question in three others.**

**Multiple Missile Lore's six classes are confirmed, and acquiring a combination is typing it.**
`multiMissileLoreTitle` and `projectileLoreTitle` name the identical six classes across the 103
documents, which was the cross-check `2026-09-16-multi-missile.md` asked for. And his sheet has no
acquisition roll for a missile combination at all: a player types the combination into the list and
the skill applies to it. That is the whole of the mechanic, and the port does the same.

**Changeling has no racial skill list, and that is the answer.** Its skills depend on the form it
wears -- his `changelingRaceSkillDetailValues` holds one list for each of 41 forms -- so there is
nothing to put in `racialSkills`. The race now carries a note saying so, and the build reports it as
a known shape rather than as missing data every run. **Gremlin, reported the same way, WAS a real
gap**: his `setRaceSkillSheet` answers it inline, before the dictionary is consulted, and that
switch is now walked by `extract_combat_tables.py` the way the inline class rows already were.
Gremlin has its ten skills. The two Fairies are answered inline as well and are deliberately not
carried, having no row in `raceStatsAndMoveDetails` -- they are not races a character can be.

**Also corrected:** `README.md` said "early scaffolding -- no system code yet", which it had said
since before any of it was written; it now describes what works, what does not, and the fact that
none of it has run in Foundry. The race item sheet and one old note still promised a "flat 27" at
11th title, superseded by the 25/27 pair. The creature sheet showed a load and never what the load
cost. The loaded movement table had no column headings, having been split from the table whose
headings it was relying on.

### 2026-09-19 — Height, frame and weight, and the colours a race comes in

The largest of the character-generator gaps, and the one a table notices first: height, frame,
weight, hair, eyes and skin were free text, typed by hand, while his sheet rolls all of them.

**His three figures are not independent**, which is the whole shape of the problem:

    race                    -> height TYPE     Human(Civilized:Village) -> "Average"
    height type             -> INCHES          a d100 down that band's ladder
    race                    -> frame TYPE      Human(Civilized:Village) -> "Average"
    frame type + STR - AGL  -> FRAME           Wispy / Light / Medium / Heavy / ...
    frame + inches          -> WEIGHT          a base for that height, plus a roll

So weight cannot be rolled before height, and the frame cannot be settled before the attributes are.
His own sheet imposes the same order — its Apply Height/Frame button sits after the attribute step —
and the port rolls all three together in one action for that reason, and for a second: rolling them
separately would let a player re-roll a height until the weight suited them.

The measure at the frame step is **Strength minus Agility**, the Player's Guide's own rule (p.34):
of two characters of a race, the strong slow one is the heavier-framed.

**Generated, not transcribed.** `tools/extract/extract_physique_tables.py` walks twenty-odd of his
functions into `module/physique-tables.mjs`: 112 races' height bands, twelve height ladders, 119
races' frame types, the frame ladder, and six frames' weight tables (12 to 35 height bands each).
Two things the parse had to be taught, both found by the figures coming out wrong rather than by
reading: **the base is per rung, not per band** (his Tiny band walks 11 and 12), and **his condition
and its assignment sit on separate lines**, so a rung's threshold has to be carried forward — the
first cut read every rung as the last one and a six-foot man came out an inch tall.

**Decisions:**
- *A half race's height is the mean of its parents' rolls, rounded up*; its frame type is the FIRST
  race's, as his half race takes the first race's body and special movement. Nothing in his code
  averages two frame types, and there is no sensible way to: they are words, not numbers.
- *The colours are offered, never enforced.* `raceFeatureHair` / `Eyes` / `Skin` are now on the race
  document as `features`, and the Details step offers them as selects — both parents' lists for a
  half race, with anything already typed kept at the top. His sheet lists them and still lets a
  player write their own, and so does this.
- *The slight-physique figures are extracted and set aside.* Every one of his functions answers
  differently for a slight physique, and the port still has no such option (a rules call open with
  him). The tables carry those figures unused, so adding the option later is reading a table rather
  than extracting again.

**Found in his data and reported** (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 37): four races a character can be are
missing from `getRaceHeightType` — Giant(Civilized) and the City, Port and Town Humans — so on his
sheet they get no height, and therefore no weight and no carrying capacity. The port fills each from
its siblings, which is unambiguous in every case, and says so on every extraction run.

**Verified:** character generation 75 (21 new), and the other six suites unchanged (combat 411,
derivation 364, creature 145, advancement 101, availability 46, walk 37); 40 modules parse.
`tools/chargen-preview.html` rolls the whole physique for its half Human|Elf with scripted dice and
the three figures hang together: 5'6" between the Average and Medium bands, a Light frame from
STR 12 less AGL 19, and 110 lb at the bottom of what that frame runs to at that height. Her hair is
offered from both parents' lists, Silvery and Green among them. **Not verified:** the Roll button in
a running Foundry V14, and its chat card.

### 2026-09-19 — The V14 API audit, and three sheets the Add buttons needed

Nothing here has ever been loaded by Foundry, and every "not verified" note on the board reduces to
that. This pass did what can be done without it: checked every Foundry API path the system calls
against the published V14 documentation, fixed what was wrong, and wrote `docs/FIRST-RUN.md` — a
smoke test ordered so that each failure is the smallest one left standing.

**Everything checked out current.** `ActorSheetV2` / `ItemSheetV2`, `DialogV2.confirm` and its
options, `Items.registerSheet` under `foundry.documents.collections`, `FormDataExtended` under
`foundry.applications.ux`, `renderTemplate` under `foundry.applications.handlebars`,
`CompendiumCollection.createCompendium`, `CONFIG.Actor.dataModels`, the `ApplicationV2` `title`
getter and `element`, and the `updateDocument` hook's four parameters. `system.json`'s
`documentTypes` declares all eleven sub-types and every one has a data model registered — a mismatch
there is the classic first-run failure, and there is none.

**Two defects found:**
- *`_processFormData` returns an EXPANDED object.* The skill sheet written earlier this pass read
  `tmpdata["system.types"]`, a flat key that would never have matched, so a skill's types would have
  reached the document as a string and failed the `ArrayField`. It is `tmpdata.system.types`.
- *Equipment, weapons and skills had no sheet of their own* — and the Equipment tab's new Add
  buttons create exactly those three and open the sheet at once, which would have been Foundry's
  generic fallback with none of this system's fields on it. The board named the trigger for
  revisiting this in September ("hand-authored content landing in `src/packs/manual/`") and it has
  now fired twice: the crowbar, and the Add buttons. All three have sheets now, following the six
  that already existed. The weapon sheet keeps his "cannot be used this way at all" apart from "a
  modifier of zero", which is the distinction his own data draws with "Non" against 0.

**A comment corrected on evidence:** two places said Handlebars comparison helpers could not be
checked for. They can, and Foundry V14 registers `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `gt`, `lte`, `gte`, `not`, `and`
and `or`. The templates still mostly avoid them, for a reason that survives the correction: the
preview harnesses render the same files through plain Handlebars, where a helper exists only if the
harness registered it. The comments now say that instead of guessing.

**What the audit cannot settle**, and the first run must: whether arbitrary keys on an update's
options survive to the `updateActor` hook — which is what stops a title advance granting its class
skills twice — the timing of derived data against that hook, and anything involving dice, chat or
notifications. All five are listed in `FIRST-RUN.md` with what breaks if they do not hold.

**Verified:** derivation 364, character generation 75 and the other five suites unchanged; 40
modules parse. `tools/item-preview.html` renders all three new sheets against real documents and
every field carries its real value — the crowbar at 5 lb tagged Custom, the Bastard Sword at 5d6+1
with cut available at +2 and missile unavailable, Herb Lore on KNW at rating 12.

## Equip Best Armour and Remove All Arms (2026-09-19)

Two buttons on the character sheet's Equipment tab, not in the generator (which has no equipment step yet).
"Best" is the most total armour value across the body, chosen greedily under the layering rules in
item-armor.mjs (max three layers, first layer flexible or padded, stiffness never decreasing outward,
no rigid on rigid except Rigid/Rigid). The first-layer rule is applied after the greedy pass, since a plate
is picked before the padding it needs. Shields and weapons are left alone. Remove All deletes (after a
confirmation), it does not unequip. Rules live in `module/equip-rules.mjs`, tested by `tools/equip-test.html`.


## Seven playable races were never extracted, and a wrong comment is why (2026-09-20)

Daryl's first real install found the faeries missing from the race list. He was right, and the
count was worse than it looked: his species picker offers 112 races and the compendium shipped 105.
The seven absent ones — Fairy, Fairy(Dark), Famorian, Formless, Maginos, Podling and Sporeling —
have no row in `raceStatsAndMoveDetails`, because `applySingleRaceToAttribs` (sheet-worker.js:32987)
answers them from a switch BEFORE the dictionary is consulted, assigning each whole row inline in
the dictionary's own 62-column shape. The extractor only ever read the dictionary.

This was not a gap anyone had to guess at. `extract_combat_tables.py` already said, in
`inline_race_skills`, that "Fairy and Fairy(Dark) have no row in `raceStatsAndMoveDetails` and so
are not races a character can be". The first half is true; the conclusion does not follow, and it
was never checked against `specieslist`, which names both. One wrong inference in a comment kept
seven races out of the build for as long as the port has existed. The comment is now corrected in
place rather than deleted, because the reasoning is the thing worth not repeating — and every
**other** race table (`raceFeatureAbilities`, `racefertiledict`, `raceAges`, the three colour
tables, `getRaceHeightType`) already had rows for all seven the whole time. Only the stats were
missed, which is exactly why nothing else complained.

**Five of the seven ship now.** Fairy, Fairy(Dark), Maginos, Podling and Sporeling are plain rows,
extracted by `inline_race_stats` and laid beside the dictionary the way `special_class_rows` already
handles the five inline classes. Races go 105 → 110.

**Two do not, on purpose.** Famorian rolls 1d3 apiece into STR/AGL/VIT from its "evoke" checkboxes
(593 lines, 33032–33624) and Formless takes its whole physical half from a host race via
`setFormlessStartingRace`. Neither is a row; both need runtime logic. Shipping them with a row of
zeros would give a character an attribute *limit* of 0 in all twelve — silently worse than the race
being absent, because it looks like data. Their other tables, and his `evokedict` and
`formlessStartingRaceDetails`, are already extracted and waiting.

**The four Maginos material variants are not races.** Maginos(Clay), (Metal), (Stone) and (Wood) are
absent from `specieslist` and picked separately, exactly as Changeling's forms are. They differ only
in endurance and whether they float, so they are carried as a note on the Maginos race — the call
already made for Changeling, reused rather than re-argued.

**The ordinary branch is the wingless one, and that is a question for him, not a choice.** Each of
these cases has two branches, slight physique and everything else, and the port takes the ordinary
one because it carries no slight-physique option yet. For Fairy, Fairy(Dark), Podling and Sporeling
that branch is the one his own comments mark "// not female", and it sets special movement to
"None:" where the slight branch sets "Fly:". So the shipped Fairy cannot fly. That is faithful to
the branch, not to what any player expects a fairy to do, so it is written into each race's
description where a Game Master will see it and raised as UPSTREAM-ISSUES item 38. Both branches are
kept in `inlineRaceStats.json` so the answer costs a rebuild, not another excavation.

**Verified, 2026-09-20:** eight suites over a local HTTP server -- derivation 364, combat 411,
creature 145, availability 46, character generation 75, advancement 101, level-up walk 37, equip 21
-- 1,200 checks, all passing. `tools/item-preview.html` renders all eleven item sheets with no
template error, and now previews TWO races: Elf(Sea) for the movement section as before, and Nixie,
because it is the one document with a populated `racialSkillNote` and so the only thing that proves
that field reaches the page. It renders "Animal Shape: (water animals only)" in full -- the note
Daryl found missing. The harness throws if Nixie ever loses that note, so the regression cannot
return quietly. A sweep of all 4,389 documents against every `choices` list declared in
`module/data/*.mjs` finds nothing that can fail validation.

**Not verified:** none of this has run in Foundry V14. The `themed`/`theme-light` classes in
particular are a documented V13+ convention applied without a V14 install to confirm them, which is
why the paper colours are also set outright on the controls rather than left to those classes alone.

## Sheet windows could not scroll at all (2026-09-20)

Daryl, on the same install: "all windows need scroll bars". He was describing every sheet in the
system. Anything taller than its window was simply unreachable — his earlier note that Tab would
"allow you to see more" was him discovering that keyboard focus was the only way to reach a field
below the fold.

**`scrollable` does not make anything scroll, and that is the trap here.** The three windows in
`module/apps/` already declared it and the twelve sheets did not, which looks like the whole
diagnosis and is not. A part's `scrollable` array is a list of selectors whose scroll position
Foundry saves and restores across a re-render; it sets no overflow and creates no scroll region.
It is still worth having — these sheets re-render on every field change, so without it a Game
Master editing something near the bottom is thrown back to the top on each keystroke — and it is
now declared on all nine item bodies and all nine actor tabs. But it is the smaller half.

**What makes a part scroll is having its height bounded.** The window content is now an explicit
flex column that does not itself scroll; the header and tab strip keep their natural size; the part
holding the form takes the rest, with `overflow-y: auto`. The load-bearing line is `min-height: 0`
on that part: a flex child defaults to `min-height: auto` and refuses to shrink below its own
content, so without it nothing overflows and nothing scrolls — indistinguishable from the original
bug. Scoped to `.imagine.sheet`, because the three apps scroll an inner body of their own and would
otherwise get two nested scrollbars.

**And a horizontal scrollbar that should never have existed.** With vertical scrolling working, the
race sheet still scrolled sideways: `.panel-row` was `repeat(3, 1fr)`, which is a floor as well as
a ceiling. Three panels wanting ~240px each demanded 745px inside a 640px window. A form should not
scroll sideways, so the row now wraps — `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(230px, 100%), 1fr))` — giving
three panels across when there is room and two or one when there is not.

**Verified, 2026-09-20:** against a reproduction of Foundry's own window chrome — a fixed-height
`.application` holding `.window-content` with real parts inside. All seven item sheets at the width
each declares in its own `DEFAULT_OPTIONS`: race 1830px of content in 642px, class 1490 in 582,
armour 886 in 642, weapon 586 in 562, skill 568 in 502, equipment 497 in 402, all scrolling
vertically, none overflowing horizontally; trait fits its window and correctly gets no scrollbar.
An actor sheet's tab likewise scrolls 2400px of content in 596px with the header and tab strip
staying put. Eight suites, 1,200 checks, still passing; `item-preview.html` renders all eleven
sheets with no template error.

**Not verified:** no Foundry V14 install. The reproduction asserts the CSS given that DOM shape; it
cannot prove Foundry V14 builds that shape. `FIRST-RUN.md` is where that gets checked.

## Handedness is rolled, with a tick to make it selectable (2026-09-20)

Asked for by the user, and it turns out to be what his sheet already does. `determineHandedness`
(sheet-worker.js:49200) rolls d100 the moment a race is applied — 1-75 Right, 76-95 Left, 96-100
Ambidextrous — and a race whose standard abilities include "Ambidextrous" always is, with no roll
at all. Nothing anywhere in his sheet offers the player a choice. The port had a dropdown on the
Combat tab and another in the generator, which was the port inventing a decision the game does not
have; the rule was already ported as `rollHandedness` and simply was not the default.

**Default off: rolled.** The generator rolls it as soon as a race is known rather than waiting for
the player to reach the Details step, because his does it on race application and making the player
press a button at a chosen moment is still a choice about when. It is guarded on being blank, so it
rolls once and then stands — `_prepareContext` runs on every render, and an unguarded roll there
would be a slot machine.

**Tick on: selectable.** A world setting, so the decision belongs to the Game Master and is the
same for everyone at that table. With it off the dropdown is GONE rather than disabled, in both
places: a greyed-out control invites clicking and misstates why it cannot be used.

**A die is on the sheet too**, which the request did not ask for and the feature needs. A character
made by hand in the Actors directory never passes through the generator, so with the dropdown gone
there would otherwise be no way to give that character any handedness at all. It rolls through
`CONFIG.Dice.randomUniform`, the same source the generator's `#die` uses, so a world running a
third-party dice module gets that module's randomness. Deliberately not a `Roll` with a chat card,
unlike the attribute saves and skill checks beside it: those are moments at the table, this is a
detail of who the character is, settled once and quietly.

**Creatures are untouched** and stay selectable. They are Game Master content, authored rather than
generated, and his rule is about characters.

**Where the setting is read matters.** `chargen-rules.mjs` and `chargen-view.mjs` are pure and
Foundry-free, which is exactly what lets `tools/chargen-test.html` import and drive them with no
Foundry present. The setting is therefore read in the generator *application* and passed down as
context, never reached for inside those two.

**Verified, 2026-09-20:** the roll walked across all 100 faces gives Right 1-75 (75), Left 76-95
(20), Ambidextrous 96-100 (5), and an Ambidextrous race short-circuits without rolling — his rule
exactly. Both templates rendered both ways: with the tick off the Combat tab and the generator have
no `<select>` and show the value with a die beside it, and with it on the dropdown is back and the
sheet's die is gone. All 41 modules parse with no syntax error; eight suites, 1,200 checks, passing.

## The same fixed bug reported twice, from a stale install (2026-09-20)

The `damageAltMode` validation error came back after being fixed. The fix was in `dist/`, nothing
else in the system writes that field, and the error text was byte-identical to the first report —
so it was the previous build still installed. The system is installed by COPYING `dist/imagine-rpg`
into Foundry's `Data/systems/`, so the copy Foundry runs is never the copy being edited, and
nothing on screen distinguished them: `system.json` had said `0.1.0` since the first commit that
created it.

Two changes so this cannot waste another round. The version is now **0.2.0** and will be bumped
whenever a build is handed over, so Foundry itself can tell the builds apart. And the init line
prints it — "Imagine RPG | Initialising system, version 0.2.0" — so "which build am I actually
running" is answerable from the console (F12) and comparable against `dist/imagine-rpg/BUILD.txt`,
which already carries the date and commit.

## "Cannot select any class but GME" was the attribute requirements, unexplained (2026-09-20)

Reported as class selection being broken. It is not: the list offers every class the campaign
allows, and the selection works. What was broken was that a class said nothing about whether this
character could take it until after it had been picked — and then only "This character does not
qualify", with no way to tell which of the ninety-nine others would fare better.

`checkClassQualification` compares each class's `attribQualify` row against the character's FINAL
attributes, after racial modifiers and the racial ceiling. Driving the real modules: a Nixie with
rolled attributes qualifies for **43 of 103** classes, and a Nixie with 10s across the board
qualifies for **1** — GME, the only class in the game with no attribute requirement at all. That is
exactly the reported symptom, reproduced, and it is the rules working. A Nixie's Strength is capped
at 11 by its own race against the 13, 14 or 15 that twenty-eight classes ask for, so a middling roll
closes most of the list.

**The fix is to say so in the list.** Every class now carries its own shortfall in its label —
"Acrobat — needs STR 13", "Alchemist — needs KNW 14, AUR 15, WIL 14" — and a line under the
dropdown says how many are open ("7 of 103 classes are open to this character as rolled"). The long
sentence stays for the chosen class, where there is room for it; in a dropdown competing with a
hundred siblings it collapses to the shortfall alone.

**Nothing is hidden and nothing is disabled.** The requirement is a rule the player may knowingly
break with the override tick, exactly as his sheet allows. Hiding the entries would silently shrink
a list the Game Master expects to be complete, and would put the override out of reach of the very
classes it exists for.

## A theme switch, and the definition cycle it exposed (2026-09-20)

Asked for: better colours in the tables, and a tick to use the standard theme instead.

**Tables.** One tint was doing three jobs badly. There are now three: alternating rows, so a value
in the last column can be traced back to the name in the first — these tables run to seventy skills
and an unbroken field of numbers cannot be read across; a heavier tint under the pointer; and a
hairline between rows lighter than the rule around panels, because a full-strength line every few
pixels turns a long table into a grid and is harder to read, not easier. Table headers are also
sticky now, so a long table still says which column is which after the first screen.

**The switch** is `Sheet colours`: "Imagine paper" (the default, unchanged) or "Foundry standard".
It is a CLIENT setting, not a world one — unlike handedness, which is a rule and belongs to the
table, this is eyesight and preference, and two players at one table may reasonably want different
answers. The classes are applied in `_onRender` rather than declared in `DEFAULT_OPTIONS.classes`,
because a window's static classes are fixed when it is constructed and a sheet already open would
have kept the old palette until closed and reopened; the setting's `onChange` re-renders instead.

**What made this cheap** is that every colour was already named in one place. The whole
Foundry-standard theme is twenty lines that re-point those names at Foundry's own variables, and
nothing else in the stylesheet changes. Getting there meant hoisting the last hardcoded hexes
(`#fdfbf6`, `#fff`, `#f3efe6`, `#ece7dc`) into the palette first.

**The trap, found by testing rather than by reading.** The paper theme pushes its colours INTO
Foundry's input variables (`--input-background-color`, `--color-text-primary`, ...) so that controls
this stylesheet never names still come out right. The new theme read those same variables back OUT
into the palette. That is a definition cycle: CSS declares the whole cycle invalid and every colour
in it resolves to nothing, which rendered as BLACK TEXT ON A TRANSPARENT SHEET the first time the
theme was switched. The fix is `:not(.imagine-foundry)` on the pushing half, and the reason is
written beside it, because the two blocks are four hundred lines apart and the cycle is invisible
from either end.

**Verified, 2026-09-20:** both themes resolved off a real rendered sheet. Paper gives ink
`rgb(28,26,23)` on `rgb(253,251,246)` with white fields; Foundry standard gives `rgb(220,215,205)`
on transparent with `rgba(0,0,0,0.25)` fields — light on dark, legible, and the fallbacks resolve
even with none of Foundry's own variables present. Row striping and the sticky header work in both.
All 42 modules parse, including the new `module/sheet-theme.mjs`; eight suites, 1,200 checks,
passing. Not verified: no Foundry V14 install, so the mapping onto Foundry's real variable values
is unproven — which is why every `var()` in that block carries a literal fallback.

## The other three windows could not scroll either (2026-09-20)

"Need to scroll up and down too on every page." The sheets were given scroll regions earlier the
same day; these three -- the character generator, Level Up and Content Availability -- were left
out of that fix deliberately, on the grounds that each already scrolled an inner body of its own.
That was true on paper and false on screen, and the reasoning was the interesting part of the
mistake.

Each of the three looked like it had already solved this, in two different ways, and neither
worked for the same underlying reason:

- The generator sized its body with `height: 100%`. A percentage height resolves against the
  parent's height, and `.window-content` had none -- so it resolved against `auto`, the body was
  never bounded, and `overflow-y: auto` on it had nothing to overflow.
- Level Up and Availability named a `scrollable` part. As recorded earlier today, that only
  persists scroll POSITION across a re-render; it sets no overflow and creates no scroll region.
  `.level-up-body` had no CSS at all.

So the same three-step shape the sheets got: the window content is a flex column that does not
itself scroll, the part inside fills that column, and the one region within it that should move
gets `min-height: 0` and `overflow-y: auto`. Headers and footers keep their natural size, which is
the point of scrolling the body rather than the whole window -- the generator's step buttons and
Level Up's standing line stay on screen while their contents move.

**Kept as a separate block from the sheets' rule rather than merged into it.** These three have an
inner scroller and the sheets do not, so a single rule covering both would have to scroll the part
AND the body, giving every window two nested scrollbars. The availability window is the odd one
again: its template root IS its part root, so it is the scroller itself rather than a column
holding one -- making it both would leave its fieldsets as flex children, free to shrink instead of
overflowing, and it would only scroll after they had been squashed.

**Verified, 2026-09-20:** against the same reproduction of Foundry's window chrome. In a 420px
window: the generator scrolls 908px of content through 330px with its footer fixed; Level Up 1068px
through 364px with its standing line fixed; Availability 552px through 383px with its form footer
fixed. None scrolls sideways, and all three report `overflow-y: auto` with `min-height: 0` on the
scrolling region. Eight suites, 1,200 checks, passing.

**Not verified:** no Foundry V14 install. As before, the reproduction asserts the CSS given that
DOM shape and cannot prove V14 builds it.

## Updates ship through Foundry's own updater (2026-09-20)

Asked for: "a way to send differential updates... check version vs the git and update that way."
That is Foundry's built-in mechanism, and it was one field away from working.

`system.json` already declared `manifest`, pointing at the copy of itself on the repository's main
branch. It did not declare `download`, and without that Foundry has somewhere to CHECK and nowhere
to FETCH FROM, so the update button never appears. Adding it is the whole change:

    manifest   .../main/system.json            what Foundry reads to see if a newer version exists
    download   .../main/dist/imagine-rpg.zip   what it fetches when one does

**The archive is committed, which is normally poor practice and is right here.** The alternatives
were worse. A GitHub Release asset is the usual home for it, but there is no `gh` on this machine
and a release would be a manual web step on every publish — the mechanism would rot the first busy
week. A tag archive that GitHub generates on demand would cost nothing, but it contains the whole
repository under a top-level folder, and a Foundry system archive must have `system.json` at its
root. So the zip goes in the repository, where `git push` publishes the manifest and the archive in
the same commit and the two can never disagree about what version is being offered. It is 0.5 MB,
which is a fair price for the update button working. `.gitignore` gains an exception for exactly
that one file; any other zip in `dist/` is still scratch.

**The zip is now built on every build, not on `--zip`.** It stopped being a convenience copy the
moment `download` pointed at it. A build that refreshed `dist/` and left the archive alone would
serve the previous version's code under the new version's manifest, which is the exact failure this
is meant to prevent. `--no-zip` remains for a scratch build.

**And a guard, because the failure mode is silence.** Foundry decides whether an update exists by
comparing version numbers and nothing else — not dates, not hashes, not the contents of the
archive. Shipping changed code under an unchanged version is therefore invisible: every install
keeps reporting itself current and nobody is offered the fix. That is not hypothetical here; it is
what happened twice on 2026-09-20, with a version that had read 0.1.0 since the file was created.
The build now compares the version being built against the version at HEAD and, when shipped files
have changed and the version has not, says so in as many words. A warning rather than a failure,
because building repeatedly without bumping is the normal state of a working day and only becomes a
mistake at the moment it is pushed.

**There is one unavoidable manual step left.** An install from before 0.3.0 has no `download` in
its own manifest and so cannot update itself — the mechanism can only be delivered by the old
means. That folder has to be replaced by hand once; everything after it is a button. The shipped
README says so under "Updating".

**Verified, 2026-09-20:** the manifest URL resolves and the repository is public — it currently
serves 0.1.0, main being thirteen commits behind, which is itself the mechanism working as
designed. The built archive holds 83 entries with `system.json`, `README.md`, `FIRST-RUN.md` and
`BUILD.txt` at its root and no wrapper folder, and the `system.json` inside it carries version
0.3.0 with both URLs. The version guard was exercised in both directions: it warned while the
version sat at 0.2.0 with `system.json` modified, and reported "this build is an update" once the
version was raised to 0.3.0.

**Not verified:** no Foundry V14 install, so the update has not been performed. And nothing is
published — the commits are local, so the manifest still advertises 0.1.0 until `git push`.

## Daryl's testing pass, six fixes (2026-09-20)

Six from his log, and the first is the one worth reading.

**A tab went blank whenever anything on it was added or deleted.** Add a language, add a piece of
gear, and the whole tab disappeared until you clicked to another and back. One cause, every tab,
both actor sheets.

Foundry computes an `active` class for the current tab and hands it to the template as
`tab.cssClass`; `changeTab` — the only other thing that puts `active` on a section — runs on a
CLICK and nowhere else, and early-returns when the group is already on that tab. Our tab templates
hardcoded `class="tab imagine-equipment"` and never wrote the active class, so it survived only
until the next re-render regenerated the part's HTML. Adding a language updates the document, the
document re-renders the sheet, the fresh HTML has no `active`, and `.tab` is `display: none`.
Clicking away and back called `changeTab`, which put it back — exactly the workaround he found.

The fix is the pattern every core Foundry sheet already uses and ours did not: pass the part its own
tab entry in `_preparePartContext`, and render `{{#if tab.active}} active{{/if}}`.

**Rolling height did nothing.** `rollPhysique` was passed `this.#state.raceNames`, and the choices
object has no such field — it holds `race1` and `race2`, and `raceNames` is what `deriveGenerator`
builds from them. So it was asked for the physique of a character with no race, found no height
table, returned no height, and with no height there is no weight either. Age was never affected
because it reads the race's own ages object, which is why one worked and the other did not.

**Remove All deleted instead of unequipping.** It did what its tooltip said and what it said was the
wrong offer. It sits beside Equip Best Armour and reads as its opposite, and the opposite of
dressing is undressing, not burning the wardrobe. It now unequips to carried, needs no confirmation
because nothing is lost, and is called "Take everything off". An item that really is to go still has
its own delete on its row.

**"Starting age 16-5000" was the race's range, sitting above a panel showing the real age.** He read
it as the character's, which is the only sensible reading of a number on a character sheet. It now
says what it is and gives the character's age beside it.

**Handedness could still be re-rolled**, which he asked to remove and was right to: "Michael's sheet
had it hard coded to make that roll and stick with it. For a reason." Ambidextrous is a large
advantage, and a button that re-rolls until it appears is choosing it with extra steps. The die is
gone from the generator, and on the sheet it survives only while the value is blank — a character
made by hand never passes through the generator and still needs its first roll. A Game Master who
wants it chosen can tick the setting, which is an honest choice rather than a disguised one.

**Colours can be rolled now**, from his own per-race lists, so a rolled colour can never be one that
could not have been chosen. It fills only what is blank, so a chosen colour survives — the same
restraint the handedness roll shows, for the same reason.

**Checked and found correct, needing a re-test on a current build:** the Nixie racial skills. He
suspected "+20% Speak to Stone" was being granted wrongly. Our Nixie row matches his
`raceSkillDetailValues` entry exactly — ten skills, Animal Shape at +20%, the water-animals note —
and Speak to Stone is not among them. Whatever he saw came from elsewhere on a build where the
class and weapon packs had failed to import entirely.

**Verified, 2026-09-20:** the height bug reproduced and fixed in the real modules — the old call
returns no height and "this race has no height table", the new one gives a Nixie 0'10", Wispy frame,
6 lb. All nine tab templates gain `active` when the part is active and not otherwise. Eight suites,
1,200 checks, passing.

## Starting money is not guessed at (2026-09-20)

**Superseded 2026-09-23:** starting money is now rolled, on the user's rulings. See "Starting money
is rolled, on the user's three rulings" below.

Asked for, and deliberately not built in this pass. His rule is fully specified and was read:
`doing_coins` (sheet-worker.js:74150) rolls an apparent social class of 5d4 for anything outside
5-20, gives non-Nobles (under 15) a Fortune roll, turns a success into a multiplier off a d100
(x2/x3/x4/x5/x8/x10), and then switches on social class 5 through 20 for the coins themselves. That
last part is a sixteen-case table, which is extraction work rather than judgement, and it is written
up for a cheaper window with the line numbers attached.

**One thing in it is a question for him, not a transcription.** The Fortune check reads
`if (tempfort <= getDieRoll(100))` — success when the d100 rolls AT OR ABOVE the character's
Fortune. Every other percentile check in his sheet succeeds on a roll at or under the chance, so as
written a LOWER Fortune makes a character MORE likely to double their money. That is either a slip
or a deliberate inversion, and it decides the sense of the whole roll, so it is going to him rather
than being quietly "corrected" in either direction.

## Slight Physique reaches the race, not just the ratings (2026-09-20)

Daryl reported a Dark Fairy listing "Wood Lore +10%" as a racial skill, which is wrong. It is also,
for a *wingless* Dark Fairy, exactly right — and that contradiction is the whole of this entry.

He then answered UPSTREAM-ISSUES item 38, which had been open since the seven inline races were
found. Slight Physique in the original rules was the modifier every female of every race carried;
when he built the Roll20 sheet he cut it loose from gender and made it a free choice, so a slighter
male and a stronger female are both ordinary characters. The wings follow the choice, not the
gender.

**The port already had the option and never let it reach the race.** The generator has carried the
Slight Physique tick since it was built, and it did one thing: −1 Strength, +1 Agility on the
ratings. Meanwhile the extractor pulled both branches of every inline race row, shipped the
ordinary one, and filed the other under `_slightPhysique` against the day the question was
answered. The two halves were never joined. So the tick was real, the data was there, and a player
ticking it got two attribute points and a wingless Fairy either way.

**The wingless form is a trade, not a penalty**, which is the part worth not losing:

    Fairy         wings, or Climb and Cover Tracks
    Fairy(Dark)   wings, or Climb and Wood Lore +10%
    Podling       wings, or nothing — no skill difference
    Sporeling     wings, or nothing
    Gremlin       flies either way; the ORDINARY form gains Climb

Gremlin is the one that would have been missed by reasoning from "faeries have wings": it has a
slight-physique variant with no flight difference at all, and the difference is a skill going the
other way. It was caught because the extractor carried both branches of the skill rows as well as
the stat rows, and the builder was written to ask both.

**Empty means "the same", not "none".** The slight form's skills are stored only where they differ
from the ordinary form's, so a Podling's variant carries an empty skill list. `applySlightPhysique`
therefore replaces the list only when the variant has one. Getting that backwards would strip a
Podling of all thirteen racial skills for ticking a box about its build, and it would look like
data rather than a bug.

**The choice is applied before the two halves of a Half Race are combined**, so a half-Fairy gets
the right form of each parent rather than the ordinary form of both.

**The label was wrong and is fixed.** It read "Slight physique (female)", which is the original
rule and not his sheet's. It now says what it is, with a line naming the five races where it
decides more than two attribute points.

**Verified, 2026-09-20:** against the real modules and the built documents. Fairy(Dark) ordinary
gives "None:" and 11 skills, slight gives "Fly:" and 9, and the two the wingless form gains are
Climb and Wood Lore. Fairy gains Climb and Cover Tracks. Podling's flight differs and its 13 skills
do not. Gremlin flies both ways and gains Climb when ordinary. Nixie, which has no variant, is
untouched by the tick. Eight suites, 1,200 checks, passing.

## Two Dark Fairy traits are missing from his table, and were not invented (2026-09-20)

Daryl also reported the Dark Fairy missing its Iron Aversion disability and its Night Vision
ability. Checked: the port is faithful and his `raceFeatureAbilities` row is what is short — it
gives the Dark Fairy only Exceptional Sight, Special Dark Shape and Requires Fairy Weapons.

Both traits exist elsewhere in his sheet. Iron Aversion goes to Brownie, Changeling, Gremlin and
Leprechaun — four of the faerie folk, which makes the two Fairies conspicuous by absence. Night
Vision in some form goes to 31 races, including Brownie and Elf(Dark), but neither Fairy.

**Nothing was added.** The sheet is the source of truth, and a racial trait invented on this side
would be indistinguishable from one of his to everyone downstream, including him. It is
UPSTREAM-ISSUES item 41, with the note that these two rows are also the two his sheet answers
inline elsewhere and may simply have drifted from the rest of the table.

## The three optional starting-kit rules (2026-09-20)

Asked for as "equip by skills, status and lore". Two of the three matched his sheet at once; "lore"
matched nothing, and rather than guess it was asked about — the answer was "gear by culture,
misremembered", which is his wilderness-equipment rule. Worth the question: the wrong guess would
have been armour lore, a combat rule with nothing to do with starting equipment.

    by CULTURE   do_coins override -- wilderness gear suited to the race, INSTEAD of coins
    by STATUS    do_clothing      -- free clothing by race, social class, gender and style
    by SKILLS    do_social_skill_equip -- each social skill taken brings its own tools

All three OFF by default, because they are optional on his sheet and a Game Master who has not
asked for them should not find gear appearing on their players. They live in the generator, which
is where his own sheet puts them.

**Parsed, not transcribed.** This is about 1,230 lines of switch across seven functions. Copying it
by hand would have been a day of work and one slip would be a wrong sword on somebody's character
with nothing to catch it. `tools/extract/extract_starting_kit.py` walks the switches, so the tables
can be regenerated when he sends a corrected sheet. Three things the parser had to get right, each
of which produced visibly wrong data first:

- **A nested switch is not a social band.** Above social 11 the weapon choice is a
  `switch(randomnum1)` with `case 1:` to `case 4:` inside the band. Read as social classes, they
  invented a social class 1 and left every band above 11 with no weapons at all. Brace depth tells
  them apart: bands sit one level inside the social switch, alternatives two.
- **A comma inside parentheses is not a separator.** "Hood(Bird, Leather)" is one item. Splitting on
  every comma produced "Hood(Bird" and "Leather)", which match nothing.
- **Fall-through has to be resolved backwards.** See below.

**His fall-throughs are real, and are followed.** Five of the six kits have bands with no `break`,
so they run on into the next band, whose assignments overwrite everything they just set. Social 5
rolls a club and a stone knife and then walks out with the social 6-7 dagger and quarterstaff;
social 12/13 ends up in the 14-and-above gear. The port reproduces this, because the sheet is the
source of truth, and reports it on every extraction run so it cannot quietly become the intended
behaviour. It is UPSTREAM-ISSUES item 42. Resolving it correctly means working from the END of the
switch backwards: a band's real outcome is its own values with the next band's resolved values laid
over the top. Laying only the next band's outright values over, and keeping the earlier band's own
die-roll branches, produced a social-5 kit his sheet never makes — the 6/7 tunic with the social-5
club.

**Grouped the way he grouped it.** Written one race at a time the clothing is 202 KB for 124
distinct strings, because forty-one races share a single case body. Collapsing identical bodies
gives twelve wardrobes and a race-to-wardrobe map: a tenth of the size, and closer to his source,
where they genuinely are one case.

**A name that is not in his equipment tables still becomes an item.** About one name in sixteen is
absent — Cape, Hose, Pantaloons, the Boubou dresses, mostly clothing. Dropping them would leave a
character short with nothing to say so, so they are created carrying the name and listed in the
generator's issues instead.

**Verified, 2026-09-20:** every extracted value spot-checked against the source by hand, including
the two-alternative bands and the renaissance corset. End to end through the real modules: a
Female Human(Civilized:Town) of social class 10 with all three ticked and the renaissance style
gets thirteen items — Armor Suit(Leather), Spear and Hand Axe from her culture, six pieces of
clothing for her status, and an abacus, costume and mask from Accounting and Acting — every one
resolved to a real document, none by name only. With nothing ticked she gets none. Eight suites,
1,200 checks, passing.

**Not verified:** no Foundry V14 install, so no character has been created through the window.

## Set Trap was there; its two variants were not (2026-09-21)

Daryl reported Set Trap missing from the skill compendium. It was in it — and he was right anyway.

Three skills are ONE row in his `skilldict` and TWO entries in his `skilllist`: Set Trap, Detect
Trap and Remove Trap each split into a wilderness form and an urban one. His own description says
so: "hidden traps, either of a wilderness or urban nature". The row carries the numbers; the list
is what a player picks from, and it offers only `Set Trap(w)` and `Set Trap(u)`, never the bare
name.

The port built the pack from the dictionary, so it shipped the three bare rows and none of the six
variants. **His class skill lists name a variant 73 times and the bare form not once; his racial
lists name a variant 33 times.** So a hundred and six grants pointed at a name with nothing behind
it, and the only way to notice was for a player to go looking for a skill their class was supposed
to have given them.

The six variants are now built from the three rows, inheriting every number and gaining
"Wilderness traps." or "Urban traps." on the front of the description. The bare rows are kept too:
four racial lists still name them, and they are what his dictionary actually defines.

**The check is the real fix.** A pack's document count cannot catch this — 674 skills looked
perfectly healthy. `check_skill_references` now follows every skill name a class or race grants and
reports any that resolves to nothing: 472 references, and it runs on every extraction. Four remain
unresolved and they are all his to answer (UPSTREAM-ISSUES item 43):

    Call of Fire          1 use,  against "Call of Flame" five times nearby
    Divine Knowledge(w)   3 uses, and no (w) variant in his skill list, unlike the traps
    Cover Track           1 use,  against "Cover Tracks"
    Plant Speak          10 uses, but it is a SPELL -- the Sporeling's racial list names it

The first three read as slips. `Plant Speak` is the interesting one: a race granting a spell rather
than a skill, which cannot resolve until the magic layer exists, and is recorded so it is not
mistaken for a typo later.

**Nothing was corrected on his behalf.** A name that resolves to nothing is either his typo or a
skill he has not written, and both are his to answer. What changed is that neither can hide again.

**Verified, 2026-09-21:** every one of the 471 names in his skill list now resolves against the
pack, where six did not. Skills 674 → 680. The six variants carry the base rows' attributes, rating
and starting dice — Set Trap(w) is AGL/INT, rating 13, 2d10%, as Set Trap is. Eight suites, 1,200
checks, passing.

## The Items sidebar is empty on purpose, and that was a dead end (2026-09-21)

Daryl: "the items menu is empty. So I can't add items to my character." Both halves are true, and
the second follows from a decision that had never been finished.

The system's content lives in COMPENDIA — `world.imagine-weapons` and its eight siblings, built by
the importer — and nothing is ever put in Foundry's Items sidebar. That is right: four and a half
thousand documents in the sidebar would bury whatever a Game Master made themselves, and the
sidebar is theirs. But the Equipment tab's Add buttons made a blank "New Weapon" rather than
offering any of the 594 real ones, so the only route to a real item was opening a compendium window
and dragging — and nothing anywhere said so. An empty sidebar plus a button that makes blanks reads
as a system with no content in it.

**The Add buttons now open a picker**: the pack for that gear type, searchable, sorted, newest
constraints honoured. Choosing one copies the compendium document onto the character, carried
rather than equipped, because a thing just acquired is in a pack and not in a hand. The blank item
is still one click away inside the picker, because homebrew needs a way in and that was the old
button's only real use.

**Three things it does deliberately:**

- **Reads the pack INDEX, not the documents.** The list needs a name and a sourcebook; fetching 594
  full weapon documents to show 594 names would be slow for nothing. Only the one picked is loaded
  in full.
- **Honours availability.** A weapon from a sourcebook the campaign has switched off does not
  appear, the same rule the character generator applies to races and classes.
- **Stays open after adding.** Kitting a character out is many additions, not one; reopening the
  window and retyping the search for each would be its own annoyance.

Long packs are cut to the first sixty until a search narrows them, with the true count always shown
above — "594 available, showing the first 60 — type to narrow it". Nine hundred rows of armour
render slowly and read worse.

**One bug worth recording, because it is the third time the same trap has bitten.** The rows are
`<button>` elements, and a button does NOT inherit colour — the user agent gives it `buttontext`.
The names came out pale grey on cream and were practically invisible, exactly as the form fields did
on a dark theme and for the same underlying reason. Caught by looking at the rendered window rather
than by reading the CSS: contrast is 15.8:1 now.

**Verified, 2026-09-21:** the template renders 594 weapons, a search for "bastard" narrows to the
four that match, a search with no matches says so, and the blank button is present. In a 560×620
window the list scrolls 1,500px of rows through 529px with the search box and the footer staying
put, and nothing scrolls sideways. 43 modules parse. Eight suites, 1,200 checks, passing.

**Not verified:** no Foundry V14 install, so the pack index read and the document copy are unproven
against a real compendium.

## The Items sidebar is populated after all (2026-09-21)

Asked for directly: fill the Items directory, grouped as he grouped things — Weapons, then each
type, Armour, and so on.

This reverses a call made earlier the same day. The compendia stay the system's own copy and remain
what the importer maintains, but leaving the sidebar empty was defensible only while nobody needed
to reach into it, and two testers in a row did. A compendium is a library; a library you have to go
and open is not where you reach for a sword mid-session. `game.imagine.populateItems()` fills it and
`game.imagine.clearItems()` takes it out again, so it is a choice rather than something imposed on a
world.

**His groupings where he has them, and only there.**

    Weapons        his `type` -- Blade, Axe, Bludgeon, Pick, Piercer, Missile, Explosive, Special
    Armour         shields first, then his flexibility classes
    Skills         his class/social split, then the sourcebook
    Classes        his classType

Equipment, races and the three trait packs have NO category in his tables — his equipment
dictionary is a name and a weight and nothing else. Those are bucketed by initial letter, which is
labelled in the code as a way of finding things rather than a claim about the game, so an "A-C"
folder is never mistaken for one of his categories.

**Missile needed splitting and his data said how.** It is 408 of the 594 weapons, which is a folder
nobody could use. A weapon with no speed of its own is ammunition — an arrow is loosed, not swung,
and he gives it no swing — which separates 317 from the 91 bows, crossbows and thrown weapons. Each
of those 317 names its launcher in its own brackets, "Arrow(Long Bow/Normal)", so they file under
the thing they fit: 26 groups of about 24. That is both his grouping and the question a player
actually asks.

**Two data faults surfaced by trying to make folders out of the categories.** A folder has to be
named, which is a sharper test of a category than anything that merely displays it:

- **Beguiler's classType and description are swapped.** classType holds a 264-character paragraph
  and description holds "Mage subclass". Left alone and reported (item 44), on the same footing as
  the Monk column repair, which edits his data and was only made once he confirmed it. The
  directory files Beguiler under "Other" rather than titling a folder with a paragraph.
- **Two skills carry "?" as a sourcebook** — Open Slot and Unavailable, which are slot markers
  rather than skills. They go in with the genuinely unattributed rather than making a folder
  called "?".

**Idempotent, and it does not overwrite.** Re-running adds what is new and leaves what is there:
a Game Master who edited a world item meant to, and a refresh that silently reverted their work
would be a poor trade for saving them a delete. Items are created in batches of 250, because one
call with four thousand documents makes Foundry unresponsive with no sign of progress.

**Verified, 2026-09-21:** the grouping rules run over the real content give 4,395 items in 86
folders, the largest single folder being Abilities/S-U at 222. Beguiler lands in Other, no folder
is named "?", and Missile resolves to 8 type folders plus 26 launcher groups. 44 modules parse;
eight suites, 1,200 checks, passing.

**Not verified:** no Foundry V14 install, so `Folder.create` and the batched `Item.createDocuments`
are unproven against a real world. That is the first thing to watch: 4,395 documents is the largest
single thing this system has ever asked Foundry to do.

## Wood Lore taken off the Dark Fairy, as an override (2026-09-21)

Asked for twice: first as "pull Wood Lore off of the Dark Faery's Racial Skill list", then again
after the contradiction was put to him. So it is done — and done through the manual layer rather
than by editing the extraction, because his own data says otherwise and the two should stay
distinguishable.

His `raceSkillDetailValues` gives the Dark Fairy's WINGLESS form eleven skills, two of which the
winged form does not get: Climb and Wood Lore +10%. That is not a bug in his data and Daryl himself
described the rule — "for Faeries without flight, at least for Dark Faeries, they gain some
additional Racial Skills". The instruction overrides the rule rather than correcting a slip, which
is exactly the case the manual layer exists for.

So `src/packs/manual/races.json` gains a Fairy(Dark) entry with `_override: true` and the ten-skill
list. The mechanism merges field by field, so everything else about the race still comes from his
tables; only `racialSkills` is laid over. Every build prints `manual-override  manual/races/
Fairy(Dark)  fields laid over his: racialSkills`, so it can never become invisible, and deleting the
entry restores his version exactly.

**Climb was left alone**, because only Wood Lore was asked for. It is the other skill the wingless
form gains, so if the intent was "the wingless form should not gain anything", Climb is the second
half and has not been assumed.

**The winged form never had Wood Lore** and is untouched — it stays at nine skills. The plain Fairy
keeps its Wood Lore, which his tables give to both of its forms.

**Verified, 2026-09-21:** the Dark Fairy ships with ten skills and no Wood Lore in either form; the
plain Fairy still has it; the override is reported on every extraction run.

## The Items sidebar is filled from the compendia, not the shipped file (2026-09-21)

Daryl: "gear is in the compendium, but not the items list." The directory had been filling from
`src/packs/documents/*.json`, the same source the importer reads, on the reasoning that the two were
the same content. They stop being the same the moment a Game Master adds an item to a compendium —
which `docs/ADDING-CONTENT.md` invites — so the sidebar was a copy of the shipped file and not of
what the compendium held.

It now reads `world.imagine-<file>` first, stripped of the compendium's identity (`_id`, `_stats`,
`ownership`, `folder`, `sort`) so each becomes a fresh world item, and falls back to the shipped
file only when the pack is missing or empty (a world that has never run the import).

Two behaviours kept deliberately: it still adds only what is new and never overwrites an item that is
already in the sidebar, because a world item a Game Master edited is theirs; and a failed batch is
now reported and skipped rather than thrown, since one document Foundry refuses used to end the run
with every later folder silently unmade.

Not verified against a real V14 world (none available). Verified with a mocked Foundry over the
shipped content plus two invented compendium items.

## Where every item comes from, out of his own Master Index (2026-09-21)

Asked for directly: find the source and page for all the items, and mark what cannot be found.

**Only skills ever had it.** His `SKILLDICT` and `SOCIALSKILLDICT` carry a sourcebook and a page
per row. `WEAPONVALUESLIST`, `ARMORVALUESLIST`, `EQUIPVALUESLIST`, the race and class tables and
the trait lists carry neither, so 3,715 of 4,395 documents shipped with both fields blank. That is
the whole of the reported difference between the Animal Husbandry sheet and the Angel Sword sheet.

**His Master Index is the answer, and it outranks anything we could infer.** `Nearly-master-index.pdf`
is the "Imagine Master Index", version 0.976, his own consolidation of "all the disparate pieces of
the Imagine Role Playing System ... found across many books". Its tables carry a `Source` column
naming the originating book, and it tells the reader to "see the original source material in the
volumes indicated". Under the source-of-truth rule that is his answer to this exact question.

It also reaches three books we have no PDF of -- Conquest of the Eternal, Legends of the Unknown,
Epitaph of the Fallen -- which is why **Angel Sword could not be found in any of the four books on
disk**. It is a Heroic Melee Weapon on Master Index page 326, and his table says so.

**Proven before it was allowed to write anything.** Skills already carry his own sourcebook on all
680 rows, so the method was run against them as a ground truth first. It reproduced his answer
**662 times out of the 670 it committed to, 98%**; the misses are names that appear in more than
one book. `extract_sources.py --verify` re-runs it and must be re-run whenever the tool changes.

**A heuristic tried and rejected, in writing so it is not tried again.** Preferring the earliest
book he published when a name appears in several sounds right -- a thing is introduced in the base
rules and referred back to later -- and measured *worse*, 97% against 98%, because it drags
anything the Player's Guide so much as mentions onto the Player's Guide. The first Source column in
his page order is the better signal.

**What the fields now hold.** 983 documents name a book of his; a page is recorded only where that
book's own index confirms it, so a page never belongs to a different book than the sourcebook
beside it. 1,710 name the Master Index and its page, for the tables of his that carry no Source
column of their own. 1,702 carry `XXX`.

**XXX is a mark, not a book, and not a rename.** Asked for as a rename -- "change name of the item
to XXX-item". It went in the field instead, because item names are lookup keys: the character
generator finds races and classes by name, class advancement grants skills by name, the starting
kits name their equipment, and the compendium importer matches by name, so renaming 1,702
documents would have made the next import DUPLICATE them rather than update them. The field
carries the mark, the item sheet shows it in red with a note, and `docs/UNATTRIBUTED.md` lists
them. `getSourcebookId` returns no id for "XXX" specifically so it cannot appear in the
availability window as a switchable book -- discovery reads books off the content, and one tick on
an "XXX" row would otherwise have hidden 1,702 items that have merely not been traced yet.

**A rights bug found on the way.** `.gitignore` named the four extracted books one line each, so
extracting a fifth produced a file that was not ignored and would have gone into a public
repository on the next `git add -A`. It is a pattern now.

Verified: 98% on the skills ground truth, 1,163 checks across eight suites passing, 41 modules
parsing, the red XXX rendered and read back out of the DOM, and XXX proven to survive its own
sourcebook being switched off. Not verified: no Foundry V14 install. Version 0.11.0.

## Legends of the Unknown arrived; Conquest of the Eternal may not exist (2026-09-21)

Two of the seven books his content cites had no PDF. Asked about them, he said they may be
unreleased and to put a pin in it -- then produced Legends of the Unknown ten minutes later.

**Legends of the Unknown** is extracted (465 pages) and its back-of-book index, pages 462-465 at
an offset of 6, is in `BOOK_INDEXES`. It confirmed 23 more page numbers. It did not move the XXX
count, because his Master Index Source column already named the book for that content -- the book
itself adds the page, not the attribution.

**Conquest of the Eternal** stays unavailable, and 100 documents cite it. Those documents are not
a gap: they carry his book name, from his own data, and are simply not page-referenced. The
distinction now lives in the code rather than in a conversation -- `UNRELEASED_BOOKS` in
`build_documents.py`, which puts a note at the top of `docs/UNATTRIBUTED.md` saying the list is a
ceiling rather than a backlog, and marks the book in the attributed table. The comment beside it
records that Legends was on that list for ten minutes, so the list reads as unavailable-so-far
rather than known-not-to-exist.

**docs/UNATTRIBUTED.md is generated now, which it claimed to be and was not.** It went in saying
"rebuilt from the content every time" while having been produced once by a throwaway script, so
the single guarantee it made about itself was the untrue one. `build_documents.py --write` writes
it, so it cannot drift from the content it describes.

Verified: 98% on the skills ground truth, unchanged; 1,163 checks across eight suites passing;
41 modules parsing. Version 0.11.1.


## The races he split with a second dropdown become races of their own (2026-09-21)

Asked for directly, with Michael's reasoning relayed: the winged faerie types need a split type,
"Fairy (Winged)" and "Fairy (Wingless)", and it should be tied to Slight Physique -- a winged form
cannot be anything but slight, a wingless one cannot choose it. Maginos should split by the material
it is built from. Famorian and Formless are missing. Undead transformations are missing, which is
expected: they are not in his sheet yet.

**Why there was anything to split.** Five of his races are ONE entry in his dictionaries and more
than one race a character can actually be, because his sheet asks a SECOND question beside the race
picker and writes the answer into the name: `maginos_material` gives "Maginos[Clay]", and the
slight-physique tick decides whether a faerie has wings. A Foundry race is an Item. There is no
second dropdown to hang off it, and an Item cannot ask a question. So each form becomes a document
of its own -- which is the call already made for the seven classes that split on a good/evil choice,
and these are named the same way: Fairy(Winged), Fairy(Dark Winged), Maginos(Metal).

**The wings ARE the slight physique, and that is his code, not an interpretation.** In
`applySingleRaceToAttribs` the slight-physique branch of Fairy, Fairy(Dark), Podling and Sporeling
sets "Fly:" and the ordinary branch sets "None:". The two rows are otherwise identical -- the
-1 Strength / +1 Agility comes from `phystrmod`/`physaglmod` elsewhere, not from the race row. So
"winged" and "of slight build" were never two choices; they were one choice read twice. Michael's
call ties them together, and the port can honour it exactly: a winged document carries
`physiqueLock: "slight"` and a wingless one `"ordinary"`, `resolvePhysiqueLock` reads it, and the
generator forces the tick and stops offering it. A winged Fairy therefore gets -1 STR / +1 AGL
whether or not the box was ever ticked, and a wingless one never does however hard it is ticked.
Verified against the real modules and the real content: Fairy(Winged) with the tick OFF comes out
at STR 11 / AGL 13 from a base of 12, flying, with 12 racial skills; Fairy(Wingless) with the tick
ON comes out at 12 / 12, flightless, with 14.

**Gremlin is deliberately NOT split**, and it is the case that would have been got wrong by
reasoning from "faeries have wings". It has a slight-physique variant too and it flies EITHER way;
the difference is a racial skill going the other direction, its ORDINARY form gaining Climb. There
is no winged/wingless split to make, so its tick stays the free choice it has always been. The four
that split are the four the user named, and no more.

**Maginos is added to rather than replaced.** Its four material rows are four full rows of his,
differing only in starting endurance (2/4/3/2 for Clay/Metal/Stone/Wood) and in whether the thing
floats (only Wood does). His bare Maginos row is byte-identical to his Clay one, and his sheet
offers [Other] for a Maginos built of something he does not list -- so the bare race stays, as that
option, and says so in its description. The four rows had in fact been extracted for months and
thrown away: `build_races` collected them into a local `tmpvariants` and never read it, writing a
one-line note on the base race instead. That is why Daryl could not pick a material.

**`sourceRace` is the mechanism, not string-stripping.** Every table but the stat row is keyed by
HIS name for the race -- racial skills, abilities, disabilities, immunities, fertility, ages, body
type, the hair/eye/skin colours, and the height and frame bands. A form is a name of the port's own
that his `getRaceHeightType` has never heard of, so each document records the race it was split
from and every lookup goes through that. Nothing parses a name to find a base, because Fairy(Dark)
would parse to Fairy and quietly hand a Dark Fairy the wrong race's skills. The generator passes
`raceSourceNames` to `rollPhysique` for the same reason; without it a split race would roll no
height, and with no height there is no weight either, which is exactly the failure mode Daryl
reported on 2026-09-20 from a different cause.

**Two lists that NAME races had to be rewritten, and one of them hid a bug.** Eleven races name a
faerie in their fertility list and 36 classes bar one, so all of those were expanded through the
split. The bug: his rule is that a race is always fertile with ITSELF, which is why no fertility
list ever names its own race and why `canRacesBreed` answers yes before it reads the list. Two forms
of one race are still one race -- but they now have different names, so a winged Fairy could not
have children with a wingless one. The siblings are added explicitly, and only where the race breeds
at all: a Maginos is a construct, his list is None, and four materials do not change that.

**The Wood Lore override followed the split.** `src/packs/manual/races.json` overrode Fairy(Dark) to
take Wood Lore off it (2026-09-21, at the developer's instruction). That was always an override of
the WINGLESS form -- his `raceSkillDetailValues` gives Wood Lore to the wingless branch and the
winged form never had it -- so it is retargeted to Fairy(Dark Wingless) with the reason recorded in
the entry. Left alone it would have become a *new* Custom race called Fairy(Dark), silently, and the
real wingless Dark Fairy would have got Wood Lore back. The build reports it as an override rather
than an addition, which is how it was caught.

**A new check, and it found four things.** `check_race_references` follows every race named by a
fertility list or a barred-race list and reports any that names nothing -- the same shape as the
skill-reference check added on 2026-09-21, and written because nothing would otherwise have caught a
list left pointing at Fairy. On its first run it found two malformed names of his (Elf(Wood)) with a
bracket too many, and Human(Barbaric)Human(Civilized:Port) with no comma between two names --
`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 45, not repaired, on the same footing as Monk and Beguiler), and it put a
number on the Famorian and Formless gap: **7 classes bar Famorian and 11 bar Formless**, so his
class data has always expected both races to exist.

**Races go 110 to 118**: less the four faerie bases, plus their eight forms, plus four Maginos
materials. Suites: derivation **392** (28 new, covering the documents, the lock, the conflict and
the source-race lookup), combat 411, creature 145, advancement 101, character generation 75,
availability 46, level-up walk 37, best armour 21 -- 1,228 checks over eight suites, all passing, 41
modules parse.

**Famorian and Formless are NOT built, and are now specified rather than merely absent.** Neither is
a row: Famorian rolls 1d3 apiece into STR/AGL/VIT from whichever of ~130 "evoke" checkboxes are
ticked and needs an animal type before it will apply at all, and Formless takes its whole physical
half from a host race. Both are subsystems, and shipping either as a row of zeros would give a
character an attribute limit of 0 in all twelve -- worse than an honest gap. What this pass did find
is that **Formless's mental half IS a literal block** in his code (33625-33650): INT +2, WIS -2,
KNW +5, CHM -2, WIL +4, AUR and PTY 0; limits 20/17/22/18/20/20/20; starting Endurance formula "1",
one die, max 1; Affinity -10, Fortune +10; poison +5, disease +10, the other three resistances 0.
That is recorded in `docs/sonnet/2026-09-21-race-forms.md` so the next pass on it starts from the
numbers rather than from the search. **Undead transformations** are confirmed absent from his sheet
and are not a port gap.

## Formless is built: a psyche and the body it wears (2026-09-21)

Asked for directly, Formless first of the two specced races. It was never a row and the port was
right not to invent one -- but half of it IS a literal, and that is what made it buildable.

**A Formless is two halves that fit exactly.** His case at `applySingleRaceToAttribs` 33625 sets
INT/WIS/KNW/CHM/AUR/PTY/WIL and their limits, the per-title Endurance roll, Affinity, Fortune and
the five resistances -- and touches nothing physical. `setFormlessStartingRace` (34880) supplies
STR/AGL/VIT/APP/SOC and their limits, starting Endurance, Perception, all movement, both jumps and
swimming, out of a host race. Between them all twelve attributes are covered once each and nothing
twice. So the race document built here is HALF A RACE on purpose, and `combineFormless` puts the
two together by taking each half whole -- it is emphatically not `combineHalfRace`, which averages,
and his own code refuses the half-race path for a Formless outright ("formless can't be half
races", 34003).

**The character holds TWO race items**, as a Half Race does, and which is which is worked out rather
than declared: `readFormlessPair` finds the formless one whichever order they were dropped in. That
reuses all the plumbing -- availability, the sheet's race list, the generator's second-race picker
-- and needed no new field on the character.

**His second copy of the physical half is NOT used, and that is a judgement call.**
`formlessStartingRaceDetails` is a 36-column dictionary holding each host's physical half, and every
figure in it already exists in `raceStatsAndMoveDetails`. The two have drifted: **22 cells across
four races** (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 47). The port reads the host's own race document instead --
one source of truth, and the eight faerie forms and four Maginos materials become usable as hosts
without a second table having to learn about them. Every difference is reported on each extraction
run, so the call is visible rather than silent, and it can be flipped if he says otherwise.

**That drift turned out to be evidence on two questions that had none.** His Formless copy of
Elf(Sea) and Elf(Ice) gives a speed multiplier of **0** where the race row gives the **-10** that
`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 24 has been asking about since 2026-09-12 -- the first independent sign of
what was meant. And his Formless copy of Gaunt writes a flat `0` and `4` where the race row carries
`0-getDieRoll(4)`, the only non-literal in the whole dictionary and the subject of item 2.

**The abilities are prose and are not in any dictionary.** `raceFeatureAbilities` has an empty row
for Formless; the real ones are string literals in `setFormlessRaceAbilities` (4576), which prefixes
its own with "FORMLESS: " and appends the host's after "HOST: ". Superior Regeneration and Corporeal
Possession, Infertile, Non-Corporeal and Detached Psyche, and immunity to Control -- taken whole,
because each carries its rules inside its brackets. **That forced a real fix**: `split_list` split on
every comma, and "Detached Psyche(Being's soul, holds the spirit, which holds the mind without a
body.)" is ONE disability, not three. It now splits only at bracket depth zero. Checked over all
4,403 documents: nothing else his dictionaries hold has a comma inside brackets, so every existing
list is byte-identical.

**What is reported rather than refused**, the pattern this project has used since the barred class:
a Formless with no host (its physical half is simply blank), a Formless inhabiting another Formless,
a second body, and a host that is not among the 110 his sheet offers. His sheet refuses a hostless
Formless outright; the port flags it, because a race here is an Item that can be dropped from
anywhere.

**Height comes from the body.** His `getRaceHeightType` answers "N/A" for a Formless (35626), so the
psyche is dropped from the list of names the physique roll is given -- otherwise a real height would
be averaged against nothing.

**110 hosts, not 106.** His dictionary holds 102 and his guard names four more (the faeries, which
split by physique); the four became eight on 2026-09-21, so the list expands through the same
mechanism every other race-name list does. A Changeling, a Mechanos and a Giant(Civilized:Seafaring)
are absent from his list, and so are Famorian, Maginos and Formless itself.

**Races go 118 to 119.** Derivation 439 (28 new for Formless, 18 for the resistance roll below).

## Every resistance roll on his sheet reports "virtually immune" (2026-09-21)

Daryl reported version 0.11.1's only Blocker: the Attributes tab showed the five resistances and
offered no way to roll any of them. Building the roll meant reading his five handlers, and they do
not work.

`handleMagicResist` (1231) and its four identical siblings read the chance out of `getAttrs`, which
returns a **string**, and then add the modifier to it -- so `"50" + 0` is `"500"`, not 50. Six lines
later `resistchance > 199` is the test for "virtually immune", and `"500" > 199` is true. **Any
two-digit resistance therefore auto-passes without the die being consulted**, and a one-digit one is
silently multiplied by ten. Verified in a real JavaScript engine against his exact lines rather than
reasoned about: 50% resistance rolling 87 reports virtually immune; 5% rolling 99 happens to give
the right answer. `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 48.

**The port does what he evidently meant** -- the figure is a number before the modifier is added --
on the footing already set by `lesserAge` and the Monk repair. His branch ORDER is kept exactly:
immunity first and it says the effect never happened, then 200% as "virtually immune", then a
rolled 100 as automatic failure, then the three-way comparison.

**Two smaller things kept as he wrote them.** His half is `parseInt((chance + 1) / 2)`, which rounds
UP -- 51% halves to 26 -- where the attribute save in the same file uses a floor; both are ported as
written rather than made to agree, and the disagreement is reported. And **a natural 1 is not a
special case in any of his five handlers**; the port makes it an automatic success because the bug
report asks for it and every other percentile check in the game works that way, but it is the one
part of this not read off his sheet and is flagged for his confirmation. It changes the answer only
against a 0% chance.

**Rolled from both sheets**, since a creature's stat block carries the same five and a Game Master
rolling a creature's Poison resistance wants the same card a player gets. Shift-clicking asks for a
modifier, which folds his two buttons per track into one rather than putting ten on a sheet.

## His errata arrives, and mostly agrees with his sheet (2026-09-21)

He supplied errata for six books plus three unpublished tables -- 2,384 lines, dated 2025 to 2026,
newer than anything else in hand. **Nothing has been built from it**, and the reason is written up
in `docs/ERRATA.md` rather than decided here: it is a THIRD source, and `CLAUDE.md`'s rule that the
Roll20 sheet beats a rulebook was written when there were only two.

**The finding that reframes it:** ten class/race restriction changes -- the errata's most directly
mechanical content, mapping straight onto each class's `blockedRaces` -- were checked against what
the port already builds from his sheet, and most were **already true there**. Fairies can already be
Tricksters; Mountain and Forest Goblins can already be Martial Artists; Kenku can already be Mage;
Dark Fairies are already barred from Berserker, Bounty Hunter and Martial Artist. One real
difference: Dark Fairies are **not** barred from Monk. So he keeps the sheet current with his
errata, and the errata reads as a record of changes already made rather than corrections waiting to
be applied.

That makes the recommended treatment **errata as a check, not an override**: run it against the
built documents, report disagreements, take them to him one at a time -- which is how
`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` already works, and which cannot silently change a rule anyone is playing. The
user's ruling is wanted before any of it is built.

**The files are not committed.** They are his rules content and some of it is in no published book,
so `.gitignore` keeps `docs/reference/errata/` local for the same reason it keeps the book text
local -- and as a whole DIRECTORY rather than a pattern, so the next file he sends does not have to
be remembered about. That was written into the ignore file's own comment the last time this trap was
found.

**`todo.txt` in that set is his own working list**, not errata -- things he intends to change and
has not. It must not be built from.

## Famorian is built, and the race layer is finished (2026-09-21)

The last unbuilt race, and the opposite problem to Formless: a Formless is half a race waiting for
a body, a Famorian is a whole race whose body is BUILT.

**His 593-line case divides cleanly in two, and that is the whole insight.** Every evoke test in
`applySingleRaceToAttribs` case "Famorian" (33032) has the shape

    if (values.famorian_evoke_end=="on") { ...the evoke's figures... }
    else                                 { ...what the race is without it... }

so the ELSE branches, taken together, are an ordinary race document -- a Famorian that has taken no
evokes -- and the IF branches are what each evoke does. Getting that round the wrong way was the
first attempt: taking the first write gave a Famorian +20% poison resistance and a 1d4+2 Endurance
roll it had not paid an evoke for, and taking the last picked up whichever evoke branch happened to
come last. Neither is the race. The extractor now tracks which branch it is in.

**A Famorian with no evokes is -4 Social Class and nothing else**, with mental limits of 19, beauty
and charm capped at 15, Social Class at 12, +5 Perception, -10 Affinity, -5 Fortune, +10% magic
resistance and **-10% disease resistance**, a 1d4 Endurance roll a title, and no special movement at
all. That last is his own: the case zeroes all nine movement figures and says "Non special
movement", so a Famorian's ordinary movement is Agility's alone.

**Of about 120 evokes, FIFTEEN change a number.** Three roll 1d3 onto Strength, Agility and
Vitality; the rest alter Endurance, a resistance, the special movement, the speed multiplier or the
jump. The other ~105 are described abilities with no figure attached, and they are listed on the
character rather than applied -- which is the call already made for racial abilities generally, not
a new compromise. `module/famorian-rules.mjs` holds the fifteen with his line number on each, so
they can be checked against his code rather than trusted.

**Order matters twice, and it is his order.** Four evokes write the same special-movement slots,
and his own comment on the first says "set fins first (swimming is of least importance)" -- so a
later one overwrites an earlier one and a Famorian with both fins and wings flies. Three evokes
write the speed multiplier, same rule. The port applies them in his order rather than the order a
player happened to tick them, so the answer does not depend on the sheet's row ordering.

**His resistance figures are absolute, not deltas**, which looks wrong until the base is in view:
Enhanced Disease Resist advertises "+20%" on his sheet and writes **10** -- over a base of **-10**.
The swing is 20. Writing it as +20 would have given a Famorian +10% instead of +10.

**The breed is rolled, with a setting to choose**, as the user directed and exactly as handedness
was done on 2026-09-20. His d100 gives Hidden Breed 1-10 (1 evoke, and only under stress), Trace
11-20 (1d2), Low 21-40 (1d4), Breed 41-60 (1d4+1), High 61-90 (1d6+1), True 91-95 (**All**) and
Inbreed 96-100 (1d6+2). "All" is an ABSENCE of a ceiling rather than a large number, because his own
gate reads `famorian_tmp_evoke_num != "All"` before it compares anything.

**The evokes are an array on the actor**, as the user chose -- closest to his own
`famorian_evoke_*_final` flags. The three 1d3 bonuses are rolled once and KEPT on the character
rather than re-derived, because a modifier that changed on every re-render would not be a modifier.
Over-budget is reported, never refused, which is the skill-slot call; so is a Famorian with no
animal type, which his sheet refuses outright (4546).

**A third copy-paste slip of his, and the port does not reproduce it.** The block that writes
Regeneration(Budding) tests `famorian_evoke_regen_NATURAL`, the same checkbox as the block above it,
so Budding can never be listed and Natural lists both. The extractor notices one checkbox producing
two different labels, hands the second to the next evoke his own `getAttrs` declares, and prints
what it did. `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 49, after item 46 (`case "Fairy"` twice) and item 45 (two
run-together race names) -- all three in long hand-written blocks of near-identical lines.

**Races reach 120 and the race layer is complete**: every race in his `specieslist` now exists as a
document. `check_race_references` is down to his two malformed names and nothing else.

## Seven modules were never being parse-checked (2026-09-21)

`tools/syntax-check.html` holds a HARDCODED list of modules, because a static page cannot glob its
own directory. Adding a module without touching that list means it is never parsed, and the suite
says nothing -- it reported a cheerful "41 modules" while there were 48 on disk.

Found because `famorian-rules.mjs` and `resistance-rules.mjs` were both written today and the count
did not move. **Five of the seven were months old**: `apps/item-picker.mjs`, `item-directory.mjs`,
`sheet-theme.mjs`, `starting-kit.mjs` and `starting-kit-tables.mjs` -- the item picker and the Items
directory among them, both shipped and both reported as working.

All 48 are listed now, and `tools/build_system.py` compares the list against `module/` on every
build and names anything unchecked or stale, so the drift cannot recur silently. A self-check that
quietly stops covering new code is worse than no self-check, because it is trusted.

## The update path works, and it has a cache window (2026-09-21)

0.14.0 was pushed and the update path checked end to end rather than assumed. The manifest at
`raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/system.json` serves 0.14.0, the archive at
`.../main/dist/imagine-rpg.zip` is a real 90-entry zip whose inner `system.json` also says 0.14.0,
and fetching the archive at the commit SHA gives bytes identical to the local build. So Foundry
can see the update and fetch it.

**But raw.githubusercontent CACHES, and the manifest and the archive are cached independently.**
Minutes after the push, `main/system.json` was current while `main/dist/imagine-rpg.zip` was still
serving the PREVIOUS commit's archive -- checked six times over two minutes and then again after,
still stale. Fetching the same path at the commit SHA returned the new bytes immediately, which
proves the push was fine and the staleness is entirely the CDN.

**In this release it was harmless**, because the two commits either side of the staleness both
contained 0.14.0: the second changed only `BUILD.txt`'s recorded commit inside the zip, so a user
who downloaded during the window got the right version with a slightly older build stamp.

**It will not always be harmless.** The two paths can refresh in either order, so a push that bumps
the version AND changes content can, for a few minutes, serve a manifest saying 0.15.0 beside an
archive containing 0.14.0. Foundry compares version numbers and nothing else: it would install the
old archive and then either believe itself up to date or offer the update again forever. That is
the same class of problem the committed-zip decision (2026-09-20) was meant to remove -- manifest
and archive travelling together so they cannot disagree -- and committing them together turns out
to be necessary but not sufficient, because the CDN can still pull them apart in transit.

**Two ways to close it, neither taken yet, because the second needs a tool this machine does not
have:**

1. **Wait before telling anyone.** Push, then leave it ten minutes before asking someone to update.
   Costs nothing and needs no change, but it is a rule a person has to remember, which is the kind
   of rule that gets forgotten exactly once.
2. **Point `download` at a GitHub Release asset instead of a branch path.** A release asset URL is
   immutable and per-tag, so there is no branch for a CDN to serve a stale version of, and the
   manifest can name the exact archive it was built with. `v0.14.0` is tagged, so the tag half is
   already in place; creating the release needs the `gh` CLI or the web UI, and `gh` is not
   installed here. **This is the real fix and it is recommended.**

Until one of them is done, the honest statement is: an update offered within roughly ten minutes of
a push may fetch the previous archive. Recorded here rather than discovered by someone whose
install ends up a version behind with no explanation.

## Daryl's race attribution, and a home for a hand-written source (2026-09-21)

Daryl (Arikail) pushed `patch-1` to his fork on 2026-09-21: "Update races.json — Added/updated
Sourcebook and page reference for the available races." It is **all 110 races attributed by hand**
to the book they actually come from, with a page number on each. That is real work and it fills a
real gap: the port had 87 of them pointing at the **Master Index**, which names itself as the
source, and 14 marked XXX.

**It could not be merged as it stood, for three reasons, none of them about the data:**

1. **`src/packs/documents/races.json` is GENERATED.** The next `build_documents.py --write` would
   have erased every edit without a word. This is the one that matters: the work was good and its
   home was wrong.
2. **It was based on the old main**, before the faeries were split and Formless and Famorian were
   built. Merging it would have reverted 120 races to 110 and taken ten races out of the system.
3. **The JSON does not parse.** Six commas are missing between `"sourcebook"` and `"page"`, so
   `json.loads` fails at the first one. The content importer reads these files directly; a merge
   would have meant no races imported at all.

**There was also nothing to approve.** No pull request was ever opened — the branch sits on his
fork, which is what GitHub's "compare & pull request" banner offers rather than something already
submitted. Worth saying back to him plainly.

**So the data was ported rather than the branch merged**, and a place was built for it to live:
`src/packs/manual/sources.json`, read by `apply_sources` and **winning over** the generated
`itemSources.json`. That matters because `itemSources.json` is itself generated, from his Master
Index, by `extract_sources.py` — anything hand-written into it is lost the next time that runs.
A hand-written source beating a generated one is also right on the merits: someone who has looked a
race up in the book it came from knows better than an index that names itself.

His 110 names map onto the port's 120 through the same expansion every other race-name list uses,
so each split form inherits its base race's attribution — a Fairy(Winged) and a Fairy(Wingless)
both come from wherever Fairy did. **118 of the 120 were his.**

**The last two were found in his own books.** Famorian is **Aspects of the Wild page 6**, from that
book's contents page; Formless is **Epitaph of the Fallen page 6**, from the Epitaph errata's own
`Pg: 6 / Formless:` heading. So every race now carries a real book and a real page, and no race is
marked XXX.

**Two independent confirmations of today's work fell out of looking.** Aspects, describing the
Famorian: *"Perception: +5% Affinity: -10% Fortune: -5% | Endurance Modifier: Starting Endurance +1,
Title Bonus (1d4)"* — which is exactly the base this pass derived from the ELSE branches of his
sheet, arrived at independently and agreeing to the number. And the Epitaph errata says Formless's
*"Wisdom Racial Maximum should be 17 (not 22), Knowledge Racial Maximum should be 22 (not 17)"* —
and his sheet's Formless case already sets 17 and 22. Both are evidence for the same thing: the
else-branch reading was right, and he keeps his sheet current with his errata.

**A near-miss worth recording about the tooling, not the data.** The first build after adding the
manual layer appeared to do nothing, and the reason was a `NameError` on an undefined `ROOT` —
invisible because the command was piped through `grep ... | head`, which swallowed the traceback
and still exited 0. The check that caught it was looking at the actual output rather than the exit
status. Pipe a build through a filter and it will lie to you about having succeeded.

## A Famorian can be made in the character generator, and a wiring bug from yesterday is caught before it shipped (2026-09-22)

Closes item 1 of `docs/sonnet/2026-09-21-famorian.md`: yesterday's pass built the Famorian race
and its rules module, tested, but the character generator had no step for it -- a Famorian could
only be assembled by hand on the sheet.

**Before writing any of that, a real bug turned up.** `_getEffectiveRace` and `_getRaceIssues` in
`module/data/actor-character.mjs` read `this.identity.famorian`, but the field lives at
`this.physical.famorian`, beside handedness -- `identity` has no `famorian` field at all. Every
read therefore fell back to `[] / 0 / undefined` silently: a Famorian's evokes were never applied
to its race, the budget check always trivially passed (0 chosen against 0 allowed), and "no animal
type" fired even when one was set, because `undefined?.animalType` is always falsy. **Not caught by
yesterday's own tests**, because they drove `applyFamorianEvokes` and `checkEvokeBudget` directly as
pure functions with hand-passed arguments -- correct in isolation, and never exercised through the
actual schema path a real actor would use.

**Confirmed the failure mode before fixing it, not just diagnosed it**: reverted the fix,
re-ran the new integration test, watched it fail with exactly the predicted numbers (`Fly:` became
`None:`, disease resistance stayed at the unmodified −10, the "no animal type" issue fired despite
one being set), then restored the fix and watched it pass. The new test
(`tools/derive-test.html`, "Famorian on the real character model") builds an actual
`ImagineCharacterData` with a `physical.famorian` block and a Famorian race item, the way an actor
in a real world holds them, rather than calling the rule functions on their own -- so a repeat of
this exact class of bug cannot pass silently again.

**The generator step**, once that was fixed:
- A `famorianBreedSelectable` world setting, the same shape as `handednessSelectable` and for the
  same reason: his sheet ROLLS the breed (`setRacialFeatures`, 16736) and never asks. Off, the
  breed and its evoke budget roll once when the Race step first sees a Famorian and then stand,
  with **no re-roll button** -- the same restraint the handedness comment names, that a button
  which re-rolls until the breed you want appears is the same as choosing it. On, a dropdown picks
  the breed, with a roll button beside it for convenience, since the choice is already honest once
  it is a dropdown.
- The three attribute evokes (Strength, Agility, Vitality) roll their 1d3 the moment they are
  TAKEN and are dropped the moment they are not -- unlike the breed, which is one roll at the top
  of the step, these are a repeatable choice, so they follow the checkbox rather than standing
  once.
- An evoke picker: all ~120, alphabetical by label, the fifteen that change a number picked out in
  bold so a player is not left guessing which ones matter, with the budget ("3 of 4") and any
  over-budget issue shown live. One column, not the skills step's compact multi-column grid --
  descriptions run to a full sentence for some evokes, and a ragged multi-column grid of those
  reads worse than a single scrolling list.
- `state.famorian` is the exact shape of `system.physical.famorian`, so `choicesFromState` passes
  it straight through with no translation, and `deriveGenerator` applies the evokes to the race
  BEFORE the ratings are built from it, so the generator's preview and the finished character's own
  recalculation agree by construction rather than by two people getting the same sum twice.

**Verified as a full round trip, not just at each layer**: real generator choices, through
`assembleCharacter`, into a real `ImagineCharacterData` built from the assembled actor's own
`system.physical`, rebuilding the identical race with no issues raised. The real Handlebars
template was also compiled and rendered against real content (not just the JS view object
inspected), catching what a pure-function check cannot -- a stray `{{}}`, a wrong field name, a
selectable-vs-rolled branch that never gets exercised. Both the selectable-breed dropdown and the
default rolled-and-standing display were rendered and checked.

**A second, smaller gap closed on the way**: `isFormless` and `formlessIssue` were already computed
by yesterday's `buildGeneratorView` and never rendered anywhere in the template -- a Formless with
no host, or with a host his sheet does not allow, showed the player nothing about why. Found while
extending this exact region of the template for Famorian. Fixed: the Half Race label reads "Host
body" for a Formless rather than the misleading "Half Race with", its own muted explanation
replaces the half-race-averaging one, and `formlessIssue` renders as an alarm line, exactly as the
class and skill-slot issues already do elsewhere on the same window.

**A third gap, about coverage rather than behaviour**: `module/chargen-view.mjs` -- everything the
generator's WINDOW and its Foundry-free preview both call, `deriveGenerator` / `buildGeneratorView`
/ `choicesFromState` -- had no automated test anywhere, only `tools/chargen-preview.html`'s manual
harness and the parse-only syntax check. That is exactly the shape of gap that would let this same
class of wiring bug ship a second time, once through the generator rather than only through the
actor model, and be found the same way this one was: by someone actually generating a character
and finding the ratings wrong. Closed with a new section in `derive-test.html` that imports
`chargen-view.mjs` directly and drives it against the real race content already loaded there.

**Suites: derivation 484 (36 new across the actor-model bug fix and the generator's own logic),
character generation 77 (2 new). Nine checks, all passing, 48 modules parse.**

Not verified: a running Foundry V14, as always. The Handlebars-level check proves the template
compiles and the right elements land in the DOM; it does not prove the `change` event wiring in
`_onRender`, the settings menu, or the actual dice rolling through `CONFIG.Dice.randomUniform`.

## Play-testing feedback on 0.16.0: retiring documents, and two things pinned (2026-09-22)

**The importer now removes documents the system has stopped shipping, from an explicit list only.**
It matches by name, so it could add and update but never notice a document leaving the source: a
world imported before the faeries were split kept plain `Fairy` and `Fairy(Dark)` beside their new
forms, and the generator offered all six. `RETIRED_DOCUMENTS` in `module/content-importer.mjs` names,
per pack, what the system once shipped and no longer does; the import deletes those, and the Items
sidebar fill deletes them from its own folder tree. **Not "delete whatever the file lacks"**: the
compendium is where a Game Master adds homebrew, and all of it is absent from the shipped file by
definition. The cost is that a future rebuild which drops or renames a document must add the old
name by hand -- the build's own history check (names in any past `documents/*.json` and not in the
current one) is how the six were found, and is the way to find the next.

**No placeholder in the race sheet's Skill note.** Nixie's note was the placeholder, and a greyed
example in an empty field reads as data: every race appeared to say "Animal Shape: (water animals
only)". A placeholder that looks like a real value is worse than none.

**Dark Fairy: Animal Shape may take a D'Wisp's form**, as a skill note on both forms, at the user's
instruction and per Aspects of the Wild p.4. Laid over the generated race through
`src/packs/manual/races.json` so a rebuild keeps it. His sheet has no Animal Shape in the Dark
Fairy's racial skills at all, so the note qualifies a skill the race is not given; that is asked, not
fixed (`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 50).

**Famorian evokes stay unrestricted by animal type -- the Game Master polices it.** The user's call,
and it is also his: his sheet takes the animal type as free text (`famorian_tmp_animal_type`,
sheet-worker.js:4519) and offers every evoke checkbox whatever is typed. **A restriction is buildable, though, and not from
his sheet:** Aspects of the Wild p.31 says every animal in that book carries an Evoke Package, and
the books hold about 190 of them as prose ("Evoke Package: Hide (Scale), Diving, Instinct
(food/water)..." -- 104 in Aspects of the Wild, 87 in Legends of the Unknown). Building it means
extracting animal -> package and matching each prose trait to one of his ~120 evoke labels, which
is judgement, not transcription. Recorded as a Backlog row in case the user wants it later.

**Pinned, by the user:** Formless body-switching -- a list of inhabited bodies and a choice of the
active one, which his sheet has -- until the rest of the core is done, with a free-text
`identity.formlessBodies` field on the Description tab meanwhile; and the clean-up of race
descriptions that carry the port's own reasoning, before public release. Both are Epic 2 rows.

## The Sonnet backlog, worked through (2026-09-22)

At the user's instruction, every hand-off note in `docs/sonnet/` was triaged against the code and the
mechanical remainder built, in nine parallel streams each owning its own files. What was decided on
the way, as opposed to merely built:

**Source attribution was nondeterministic, and is fixed.** `resolve` in
`tools/extract/extract_sources.py` tried a name's spellings longest-first, but spellings of equal
length came out of a Python set, whose order changes on every run. A rebuild moved Tongs(Large) from
his equipment price table to a passing mention in a skill's tool list with no code change. Now a fixed
order: longest first, then the book's printed "Stem, Qualifier" form before his bracketed spelling,
because his brackets are how he writes a name in HIS lists and cross-references. Checked against the
last commit: three items moved, all three to their proper table (Crossbow(Heavy) to the weapons
table, Spectacles(Reading) to the equipment table, Goblin(Forest) to the race section -- the last is
overridden by `manual/sources.json` anyway). Verify accuracy unchanged at 662/670.

**A plural rule for source matching was tried and rejected**: "Claws" -> "Claw" landed
"Springs(Assorted)" and "Feathers" on Hermetic Lore ingredient tables. Recorded in the code so it is
not re-tried. The one rule kept, stripping a trailing range number ("Infravision 60"), attributed
fifteen abilities, all to the right page.

**`isRestricted` comes from the books, and social skills have none.** The Player's Guide defines two
different fields: "Restricted: Yes/No" (may it be tried untrained) for class and racial skills, and
"Restrictions/Modifiers" (race eligibility) for social skills. So the 204 social skills are not
misses; there is nothing to find. His sheet has no restricted flag of its own. 366 of 676 skills
found, 305 true; the rest are social, from Conquest of the Eternal (no book), or listed by the build.

**"Open Slot" and "Unavailable" are not skills.** They are the sentinel values his skill dropdowns
count to find free slots (sheet-worker.js:7008, :7551). No longer built as documents; added to
`RETIRED_DOCUMENTS.skills` so an existing world loses them on the next import.

**The untrained-skill list is NOT shown yet, on purpose.** The rule is written
(`getUntrainedSkillOptions`, skills-rules.mjs), but with real data about 370 skills qualify, so how to
present it -- a count and a search, or a list -- is a presentation call, not a mechanical one.

**Multi-missile acquisition by roll is ported as rules, without a button.** His
`handleRollMultiMissileKnow`/`Lore` (sheet-worker.js:88805/88950). The hand-off note said a failed
attempt locks the combination out until the skill rises; **his code has no such lockout** and no
critical-failure test in either handler. Ported as his code reads. The note was wrong, not the code.

**Quality is a new field, distinct from construction quality.** `item-weapon.mjs` already spoke of
"construction quality" for structural strength, a different scale with different multipliers; the
weight quality is its own `quality` field and does not reuse it.

**Two build-tool defects fixed:** `git_output()` in `tools/build_system.py` decoded git as cp1252 on
Windows and corrupted non-ASCII names; and the new retired-documents sweep found the two skill
sentinels above.

**Localisation stays closed.** Every "localise, if the other tabs do" item across the notes is
answered by the 2026-09-19 decision that strings are not localised; none were acted on.

**The What's New window** (user's request, same day) shows CHANGELOG.md itself rather than a second
copy of release notes; per user (client setting) so each player sees updates they missed; only the
version sections, never the publishing preamble; and a small Markdown reader of its own that escapes
before it formats, because nothing in Foundry's public API promises one.

## Situation Mods: the melee and missile modifiers window, and Second Weapon held per weapon (2026-09-22)

**Asked for by the user: "a ranged and melee modifiers popup/popout submenu", and "make sure there is
a check for 2nd weapon knowledge / lore that applies the appropriate mods".** Built on Opus at the
user's choice; martial arts, asked for in the same message, is a separate pass by a separate agent
and has its own entry.

**Second Weapon Knowledge and Lore never applied in play, and now do.** `resolveOffhandPenalties`
read two per-weapon booleans, `secondWeaponKnowledge`/`secondWeaponLore` on `item-weapon.mjs`, and
**nothing ever set them**: no template showed them and no code wrote them, so every off-hand attack
paid the full Agility-banded penalty whatever the character's skill. The unit tests passed because
they set the flags by hand. His sheet does not store those flags as a free choice either: it keeps
one comma-separated list of simplified weapon names per discipline (`second_know_list` /
`second_lore_list`), and `handleSecondWeaponKnow` / `checkEquippedWeaponsAgainstSecondWeaponKnowList`
(sheet-worker.js:90648, 90855) switch a weapon's `weaponN_2weapknow` on only when its name is in the
list, and off when it is not. **So the list is the authority, and the flag is derived.** The
character carries `combat.secondWeaponKnowList` / `secondWeaponLoreList` in his shape (a string, as
the five lore lists already are); `getSecondWeaponFlags` works the two flags out per weapon, gated by
the title eligibility already derived, and the attack, the weapon rows and the Situation Mods window
all call it. The two booleans are **removed** from the weapon rather than left as a second source
that could contradict the list -- the same call made for `offhand`/`twoHanded` earlier. Slots follow
his `set2ndWeaponKnowSheet`: one weapon per title held in the discipline, counting the title it
arrived at (`(title - when) + 1`), less those named, negative shown rather than trimmed. The chat
card also now shows the off-hand damage it was already rolling (it had been missing from the
breakdown).

**Situation Mods are stored on the actor, not asked per attack.** His combat page has one bar,
"SITUATION MODS", whose dropdown opens a melee panel or a missile panel; SET totals the ticks into
five figures that every later attack of that kind reads until they are cleared. That is kept rather
than turned into a per-attack dialog for two reasons: it outlives any one attack (a flanking position
holds for several swings), and **the defence figure belongs to the character, not the attack** --
Furious Attack leaves the attacker +4 easier to hit while it is set, and "No Defense" (blind, cannot
see the target, a critically failed Critical) takes their adjustment away from anyone attacking
them. So `system.combat.situation` = `{ kind, selected, weaponId }` on both actor types; the actor
totals it in `_prepareSituation` (character) / `_prepareCombat` (creature), adds the defence onto
`defensiveAdjust`, and exposes `combat.noDefense`, which the attack dialog reads off the TARGET to
start its "avoiding the blow" box unticked. The window (`module/apps/situational-mods.mjs`) writes as
it is ticked, so an attack made with it still open sees the change. Opened from a bar on both Combat
tabs, or `game.imagine.situationMods(actor)`.

**Every figure is from his SET handlers, not his labels** (`handleMeleeSet` / `handleMissileSet`,
sheet-worker.js:72874, 72990). **A multiplier is additive** -- each "x2 Dam" adds one to a running
figure from 1, so charge plus wall is x3, not x4 -- and held at x3, which is his SET's own cap and the
Player's Guide's. The exclusions are his change handlers (17107-17850): one position per axis, one of
each visibility, one size of twenty-four, one range; a medium or longer range clears double and
triple fire; Wrong Type/Size ticks Override Type Check. **Six options are set only by a skill roll**
(Critical, Focused Attack, Surprise Attack, Brace, Perfect Shot, Quick Load) -- his handlers untick
them if a player tries -- so the window gives each a Roll button: d100 against the skill's chance
plus the chosen weapon's skills modifier (lore's skills bonus and the off hand's skills penalty,
which is his weapon Skills Mod column) plus an optional modifier standing in for his MOD prompt. A
critical success also sets the Crit, a critical failure only the Crit Fail, and a roll clears the
three first so a second roll replaces the first. `resolveSkillOutcome`'s +/-20 thresholds are his
exactly (`criticalSuccessChance = total - 20`).

**Three readings, recorded so they are not re-litigated:**
- **The multi-missile boxes do not add their own penalty.** His missile panel has 2 Weapons / 2 / 3
  Projectiles with -4/-6 and -8/-12, and his attack then refunds them for Multiple Missile Knowledge
  or Lore. The port already does both halves in `resolveMultiMissile`, so the box picks the firing
  mode (the attack dialog's Firing starts on it) and counts nothing itself. Counting both would
  double the penalty.
- **Set for one kind, the other kind's attack reads none of it, special words included.** His
  `handlePhysicalAttacks` zeroes the other kind's to-hit, damage and multiplier, and has the line
  that would clear the special words commented out. They are cleared here: a missile panel's "Max"
  or "+1 per Die" reaching a sword blow cannot be meant, and the one word that must reach an attack
  -- Desperate Defense's "No Attack" -- is melee's own.
- **In the character's `situational` the special words are data; the attack applies five of them**
  (`Max` rolls every die at its highest via `evaluate({ maximize })`; `+1`/`-1 per Die` count the
  weapon's dice; `Half Dam` halves; `Called Shot` pre-ticks the called shot; `No Attack` refuses the
  attack). The rest -- `Random Location`, `Half Reload Speed`, `Wrong Projectile`, `Ignore Projectile
  Type`, `+20% Skills`, `Blind`, `Can't See Target`, and Quick Load's critical failure -- are printed
  on the card for the table, since nothing in the port models them (`getSituationalNotes`).

**Labels.** His card prints set modifiers as "Situational(+N)", so that label now means the Situation
Mods; the free number typed into the attack dialog becomes "Modifier" (his roll prompt's
`?{Modifier}`), on both the character and creature paths. `creature-test.html` was updated for it.

**Martial arts plugs in, rather than being duplicated.** His melee SET adds the better of stance and
lore blind fighting when the attacker is blind or cannot see the target, keeps the defence for a
"Full Defensive Mod", and drops the two special engagements while a martial stance is held.
`resolveSituationalMods` takes those three as `{ blindFighting, fullDefense, inStance }`, and the
character reads them from `combat.martialBlind` if the martial arts derivation has set it -- which it
runs before `_prepareSituation` for that reason.

**Not verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14 -- the window opening and re-rendering on the
actor's update, `actor.apps` still being the re-render registry in V14, `Roll#evaluate({ maximize })`,
the two dropdowns' change listeners, and the new schema fields reaching the database. Checked: 503 /
507 / 149 / 46 across combat, derivation, creature and availability; 51 modules parse; the real
template rendered in `tools/situation-preview.html` for both panels, and the combat tab's bar and
Second Weapon lists in `tools/sheet-preview.html`.

## Martial Knowledge and Martial Lore: the subsystem, ported, and a dropdown on the Combat tab (2026-09-22)

The last unbuilt piece of combat phase 2's "martial arts and stances". Built from his code -- every
function that reads the eight martial dictionaries was read, sheet-worker.js:66168-69100 and
98801-100838 -- with the Player's Guide (pp.93, 95-97), Mysteries of the Planes p.167 for the
stances, and his errata (the Master's Manual's missing throws-by-discipline table matches
`setMartialKnowArts` exactly; the Player's Guide hold speeds match his table).

**What his subsystem is.** Martial Knowledge is one class skill and everything under it a SUBSKILL,
rolled against its chance plus the subskill's modifier -- (16 less the subskill's rating) x5%,
Player's Guide p.93, whose own worked example (Knowledge 60% makes a Martial Kick 80%) is now a test
through the whole character model. A DISCIPLINE, chosen once (Offensive, Defensive, Balanced,
Contact, Custom), decides which attacks, blocks, holds, moves and throws are known. Martial Lore is a
second, restricted class skill: twelve subskills of its own at rating 18, the right to learn anything
outside the discipline by a Lore roll, blind fighting, and the mastery of stances. Attacks are two
rolls, the skill and a d20 to hit on the ordinary chart, and a hit whose skill roll failed lands for
half. Holds and throws need a touch first. MOVES are the only family that changes numbers elsewhere:
made, they add to the attacks after them until cleared. STANCES, one held at a time, change to-hit,
damage, defence, initiative and the speed of offensive actions.

**Generated, not transcribed.** The eight dictionaries have column maps from his own header comments
(`column_maps.py`, 37 clean) and `extract_combat_tables.py` emits them typed into `combat-tables.mjs`,
together with the numbers his dictionaries do NOT hold, which live in three handlers and are walked
out of them: `handleStanceOn` (both live branches of every stance), `handleMartialModifierSet` (what
a made move adds, and which moves the Spinning rule guards), `handleMartialLoreModifierSet` (Flip),
plus the four preset disciplines and Martial Lore's blind-fighting rule. Every subskill's modifier
is checked against the p.93 rule each run; Jump and Immoveable Stance are reported.

**The deciding rule, where his code argues with his own prose.** Where his code and his own
dictionary text for the same move or stance disagree, and the Player's Guide sides with the text,
the text is taken as what he meant: Flying without Jump's copied +1 damage, Spinning +2 to hit not
+4, Double Attack +1 second not -1, Drunken fighting per die not an extra die, Flow as water's +1
second applied, Immoveable Stance -5 not +5, and Martial Lore values rolled against Martial Lore. The
generated tables stay his code; the port's choices are three small correction tables in
`martial-arts.mjs`, each with its reason, so each is one line to reverse. Where his code is
consistent with itself and only the book says more (Martial Lore's blind fighting, Flying "replacing"
Jump, Immoveable Stance forbidding attacks), his sheet is followed. All of it is UPSTREAM item 56,
along with seven outright slips -- the worst being that a successful move roll writes "fix" where
SET reads "on", so a made move never counted on his sheet without ticking the box by hand.

**What is character-wide is folded in; what is per-attack is handed over.** A stance's defence and a
made Flip go into `combat.defensiveAdjust`, a stance's initiative into `combat.initiativeMod`, and its
change to offensive speed into `combat.weaponSpeedMod` -- so the defence every attacker reads, the
initiative roll and every weapon's time all follow the stance without anything else knowing about
it. What belongs to one attack -- the stance's and the moves' to-hit, damage, extra dice, per-die
damage, multiplier, Strength handling and seconds -- is returned by `getMartialAttackModifiers(state,
{ mode, martialAttack })` in the same `{ label, value }` shape `getToHitModifiers` lists, for the
weapon attack to append. Missile attacks take the stance's missile to-hit and nothing else, as his
missile branch zeroes the rest. Blind fighting goes to the Situation Mods as `combat.martialBlind`,
since it only offsets their blindness penalty. Immoveable Stance's "No Defense" is
`combat.martialDefense.noDefense`.

**Stored in his shape.** `system.martial` holds his comma-separated lists: the discipline, what is
learned beyond it, Lore values, stances learned and mastered, and what is in play (stance, moves
made, Lore values made). Derived in `_prepareMartialArts`, after the skills (whose chances it reads)
and before `_prepareSituation` (which reads its blind fighting). Nothing applies without Martial
Knowledge held and past its title; a stance must be learned to be held, a move known to be made.

**The Combat tab** has a Martial Arts heading that opens into a panel -- the dropdown the user asked
for: discipline and stance as form fields, moves as chips (the die rolls it, and made it stays in
play; the name toggles it by hand, his tickable success box), every subskill with its chance and a
roll, Martial Lore values, the learning rolls, and his lists as text fields for Custom picks and
Game Master fixes. What the panel shows is built by `module/martial-view.mjs`, called by the sheet
and by `tools/martial-preview.html` alike, so there is no private builder copied into a harness to
drift. A martial attack posts a card carrying the weapon card's own flag, so Apply Damage and Spend
Seconds are attack.mjs's buttons and the damage runs through the one pipeline; its damage type is
the book's, since his sheet has none. A Scissor Strike is two cards, doubled when both blows land
and the skill is made.

**Not built, deliberately:** the missing-limb checks (the port does not track lost limbs); stance
bonuses to other skills and saves, which his sheet prints and never applies; a Lore value's speed,
which his table does not have; and creatures, whose sheet in his Roll20 has the same section -- the
rules take a state, not a character, so a creature can use them, but no creature UI exists.

**Verified:** `tools/martial-test.html` 150 checks (tables against his dictionaries and the errata,
every correction, every move, stance and Lore value, the attack modifiers for weapon, missile and
martial attacks, damage, touch, failed moves, all four learning rolls, and the character model end
to end); combat, derivation, creature and availability unchanged; `tools/martial-preview.html` renders
the real Combat tab and martial card against a real Martial Artist at title 6 (14 checks). **Not
verified:** anything needing a running Foundry V14 -- the dropdowns saving, the panel's open state
surviving a re-render, the dialogs, `Roll#evaluate({ maximize })`, and the new schema reaching the
database.

## The Magic & Lore tab, his starting lore, and the content behind both (2026-09-22)

Asked for directly: "Add a magic, lores, herbs, and potions etc tab to the character sheet and
populate with relevant items. Also afik you are not generating relevant entries and inventory for
lores." Both were true. His Magic/Lore tab (the "e" button, `sheet-magiclore`, sheet HTML 20087-30416)
had no counterpart, none of its content had ever been shaped into documents though seventeen of its
dictionaries were extracted, and his creation step's "Provide random lore" was not ported at all.
The user asked for the implementation to go ahead while they were away; this pass ran on Opus
without the usual model question.

**It brings part of Layer 4 forward, on purpose, and only part.** CLAUDE.md defers magic until the
core is done. What is built here is the CONTENT and the LORE side -- what a character carries and
knows, how it is learned, used and memorized -- not casting. Spells and invocations are known,
memorized at their level and read out; Aura Control, spell lore, the fail chance and the invocation
engine are still Layer 4, and the tab says so where it shows them.

**Four item types, not seventeen.** His tab is seventeen repeating sections, but they are four
shapes: `consumable` (herb, potion, elixir, charm, poison -- carried as doses), `lore` (ballad,
candle ritual, empathy ritual, glyph, hymn, poem, poison recipe, potion recipe, ritual, rune, song,
sympathy ritual, evoke -- known, rated, memorized), `spell` and `invocation`. The KIND is his own
section name, so it also names the magic switch (`MAGIC_SUBSYSTEMS` in availability.mjs was already
keyed by those sections), and the item carries `system.subsystem`, which availability had been
waiting for ("magic content items, once they exist, will carry a subsystem field of their own").
The one table of kinds -- label, switch, learn skill, use skill -- is `MAGIC_KINDS` in
`module/lore-rules.mjs`.

**Names are not unique across kinds, so these packs match on kind AND name.** "Anger" is a song and
a poem, "Break Love" a candle ritual and a ritual, "Healing" a ballad, a song, a poem and a potion.
The abilities/disabilities/immunities precedent was three packs; thirteen lore packs would bury the
compendium list, so instead the importer, the manual-content layer, the Items sidebar and every
look-up key on kind and name for the consumables and lore packs (`matchKind` in content-importer.mjs,
`KIND_KEYED_PACKS` in build_documents.py). A manual override that names no kind is refused when its
name is shared, rather than laid over whichever came first; tested.

**The content: 2,486 documents.** Column maps for all seventeen dictionaries from his header comments
(`column_maps.py`, 54 clean), four new builders, packs `consumables` (515), `lore` (961), `spells`
(550), `invocations` (460). The existing nine packs rebuild byte-identical. **Poisons are not
documents**: his are built from a type (I-XXV) and a potency (A-Q) by three switches in
`getPoisonDetails`, walked into `POISON_TYPES`/`POISON_POTENCIES`, and the tab builds one from a
small form, as his sheet's three dropdowns do. Hymns carry the alignment of the starting list they
appear on, which is the only record of it his data has.

**Not attributed, and marked so.** Attribution looks a document up by NAME, and here a name is not
enough -- his rune Balance would take the Balance skill's page, and his spell and invocation Chill
are different entries. All four packs are XXX until an attribution pass that knows the kind exists
(`NOT_YET_ATTRIBUTED_PACKS`); UNATTRIBUTED.md summarises them in one paragraph rather than 2,486
lines, and the Items sidebar keeps them in their kind folders instead of pulling them into the XXX
folder.

**Starting lore is his chain, walked rather than transcribed.** `tools/extract/extract_lore_tables.py`
follows `provideRandomLoreAndLoreItems` link by link -- thirteen steps, each counting one or two skill
names and drawing that many different entries from a list of his -- and writes `module/lore-tables.mjs`:
the chain, the nineteen lists (1,178 names), the poison tables, the five casting skills, the three
starting-spell d100 ladders and the twelve spell primers. Every name is checked against its
dictionary each run: two miss (`Zebra Gras`, and the hymn `Injury`, which has no row), UPSTREAM 58.
The rules (`rollStartingLore`) are his wherever he is consistent: hymns by alignment first, then
unaligned (or a d2 with neutral for the neutral); poison types by alignment with 2d6/2d4/1d4+1 doses;
potions 1d3; herbs by value (platinum 1d2 ... copper 3d6+1); the common Herb Lore roll at +20 for one
more herb unless the race takes nothing in; and starting spells for a caster whose best casting
skill is one of his five -- the greater of 1d4+2 and a tenth of the chance, offensive, defensive and
utility in turn, and a primer on an Affinity or Fortune roll.

**Three places the port departs, each reported.** (1) His Poison Lore step never clears `first`, so
two instances give one recipe; the port gives one per instance, as its own comment says and every
sibling does (UPSTREAM 57). (2) His duplicate test is a substring test ("Healing" is refused after
"Super Healing"); the port compares names. (3) His draw loops for ever if a list is shorter than the
count; the port stops. Kept as he has it, though it may surprise: the count reads his class rows for
titles 1-10, so a new White Witch starts with a potion recipe from her title-8 Potion Lore
(UPSTREAM 60).

**The generator's tick is ON by default; his is off.** His last creation step leaves "Provide random
lore" unticked ("If unchecked GM can provide after generation"). The report was that the port does
not generate lore at all, so the tick defaults on here, in his own words, on the Review step. The
Game Master's "Provide starting lore" button on the tab is his "GM can provide after generation", and
is how a character made before this, or by hand, gets it. Running it twice never teaches an entry
twice; doses go onto the stack already carried.

**Rolls follow his handlers.** Use (`handleUseBallad` and its twelve siblings): the use skill --
Intone for a hymn, Recite for a poem, Sing for a song, the lore itself otherwise -- plus a situational
modifier (his MOD button; Shift-click here), floored at 0, then the entry's own modifier, floored
again; it must be memorized; 200% is a Grandmaster and a natural 100 always fails. Learn
(`learnNewBallad` and siblings): the lore skill and the situational modifier only, nothing twice; the
picker rolls it by default and a tick adds outright. Brew (`handleUsePotionRecipe`,
`handleUsePoisonRecipe`): the lore against a batch size, no memorization needed, a success adds the
batch. Memorization: (goal + 1) x Knowledge's points, against the rating of each memorized lore and
the level of each memorized spell and invocation, with his one allowance kept -- a single item may
exceed the total. Practitioner title from `storeTempSkillChanceAndMessage`: a class skill (title + 1 -
acquired title), a racial or common skill the character's title, a social skill 0.

**What a use does not do yet.** Every one of his use handlers ends in a `do<Kind>Action` switch that
writes the effect with the practitioner title worked in -- "heal all listeners for 3d4=7 damage in up
to 3 wounded body area(s)" -- and some change the character (Badger Thorn adds half Endurance). Those
run to many thousands of lines and are not ported. A use reports the roll, the practitioner title and
the entry's own description; applying it is the Game Master's. That is the next real piece of this
work, and it needs judgement, not just transcription.

**How it was checked.** `tools/lore-test.html` (103, new) covers the extraction, every rule, reading a
stub character, making items by kind and name, the view, and -- against the real built packs -- that
every name the starting lists can draw is a document, bar his two. `tools/magic-preview.html` (new)
makes a White Witch, a Shadow Elf Bard and a Warrior through the generator's own `assembleCharacter`,
derives them with the real model, rolls their starting lore through the real code against the real
content, and renders the tab: 15, 15 and 0 entries. The window test gained the four sheets (27), the
manual-content test the four packs and the kind-keyed override (122); availability 46, importer 9 and
character generation 83 unchanged; 63 modules parse. **Not verified:** anything needing a running
Foundry V14 -- the tab's buttons writing to items, the dialogs, the picker's learn roll, the
generator giving lore after it creates the actor, and the importer building the four new compendia.

## Spinning is +2 to hit, by the user's ruling (2026-09-22)

The martial arts pass found Spinning at +4 to hit in his `handleMartialModifierSet`
(sheet-worker.js:68198) but "+2" in his own move text and "by 2" in the Player's Guide, and built +2.
Asked, the user ruled **the book's +2**. Nothing in the code changed -- `MARTIAL_MOVE_CORRECTIONS`
already carried it -- but it is now a ruling rather than a reading, recorded at the correction and at
`UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` item 56.2 so it is not reverted to his +4. The other four martial questions
(Martial Lore value speeds, stance skill and save bonuses, Martial Lore blind fighting, creature
martial arts) are still open with the user.

## The round clock: his Mr. Initiative chart, one per combatant (2026-09-22)

**Asked for directly:** "a time tracker for each player. take the init values and modify by seconds
until we reach the end of that turn." The user chose all of it: a clock in every row of the combat
tracker AND a window with everyone on one chart, plus carry-over, off-hand seconds and speed seconds.

**It already existed on paper, as his.** The Master's Manual's "Mr. Initiative" (pp.98-100) is a
photocopiable board for exactly this: a Split Second row (-10 to -1), the ten-second Combat Round,
an Extra Seconds row with every second cut in two (1a 1b 2a 2b...), an Off-Hand row (five, ten for
the ambidextrous) and a Carry Over grid up to sixty seconds. His Roll20 sheet has none of it -- it
rolls initiative into Roll20's tracker and leaves the rest to the table -- so the chart is the design,
and the rules come from the Player's Guide (p.168 Initiative and Carry-Over, p.178 Timing in the
Combat Round) and the Master's Manual (p.2, Initiative Adjustment: a point below -10 is an extra
second, ten at most). The build keeps the event-time round that was already there -- initiative is
the second a combatant can act in, spending seconds moves them on and the tracker re-sorts -- and
adds the history behind the number.

**What was decided, and why:**

- **The clock lives in the combatant's flags.** `BaseCombatant`'s update permission lets a player
  write `initiative`, `flags`, `defeated` and `system` on their own combatant and nothing else
  (checked in the V13 install's `common/documents/combatant.mjs`), so a player can spend their own
  seconds without a Game Master's client relaying it. A Combatant data model would need a
  `documentTypes` entry for no gain. The clock is keyed by round, and ignored once the initiative is
  cleared, because Foundry's Reset Initiative writes the whole combat at once (`resetAll` ->
  `Combat.update({combatants})`) and never touches the flags.
- **The initiative number stays what the tracker sorts and shows.** Before a spend it is the roll
  (a -4 stays a -4); after, the second they next act in, counting on past 10 (a 13 is the third
  second of the next round, which is what adding seconds to initiative always gave). The clock is
  the history: the roll and every spend, main hand and off hand, which is what the chart draws and
  what undo takes back.
- **Any initiative written from outside the clock is a new start.** `ImagineCombatant._preUpdate`
  resets the clock when initiative changes without `{ imagineClock: true }` -- a roll, or the Game
  Master typing a number into the tracker. Checked in the V13 client backend: `_preUpdate` runs per
  document before the diff and before `_preUpdateOperation` works out the turn, so the reset flows
  through a batched `rollInitiative`.
- **Order** (`getClockSortKey`): a sped combatant's extra half-second sorts half a second before the
  ordinary second it splits; a roll below 1 not yet acted on orders the first second by its value;
  the more extra seconds the earlier among the sped (his "-10 minus the # of speed seconds"). Done
  combatants sort after everyone still acting, by when they come back.
- **Extra seconds**: the roll's (below -10) plus an effect's, ten in all. The effect's are a new
  actor field, `combat.speedSeconds` -- his `tmp_speed_seconds`, the Speed Seconds box among his
  combat modifiers -- entered by hand on the Combat tab or in the window until potions and spells
  set it. **The sheet beats the chart twice here**: his sheet says speed seconds come BEFORE the
  normal second where the chart adds them in the second half, so "a" is the extra half; and his
  sheet has a sped character's initiative set to -10 less the speed seconds, so anyone with speed
  seconds starts at 1a whatever they rolled. Asked as `UPSTREAM-ISSUES.md` 61.2.
- **The off hand** is its own pool: `getOffhandSecondsCap` (5, +1 per 20% of Second Weapon Lore, 10
  ambidextrous), less half the seconds a late start lost (all of them if ambidextrous), never more
  than the round has left from where the main hand stands. An off-hand spend moves nobody. Spent
  past the pool is shown in red, not refused -- the port's standing pattern. This closes the
  question left open on 2026-09-14, when the cap was shown but "not enforced as a round-tracker
  pool" for want of per-round state. Which pool an attack uses is `getActionHand`, which differs
  from `isOffhandWeapon` on purpose: an ambidextrous fighter pays no off-hand PENALTY, but a sword in
  the left hand is still on the left hand's seconds.
- **Carry-over** is elected by default and declined per combatant (a fresh roll instead). Two kinds:
  an action still under way carries its remaining seconds and, in the round it finishes, a reaction
  roll added to its last second; an initiative past 10 carries the wait with no roll. The reaction
  roll is made **as the new round begins** rather than at the second the action finishes, because
  nothing about the roll depends on when it is made and it puts the combatant in the right place in
  the tracker at once; it is posted to chat like any initiative. A roll of 0 or less counts as 1
  (UPSTREAM 61.1). An action that ends exactly on the tenth second carries nothing -- a fresh roll
  next round is the same as a reaction roll added to second 10. Long actions carry round to round,
  as his sixty-second Carry Over grid does, and roll only in the round they end.
- **The round is announced over, not advanced.** When everyone standing is past their last place a
  notice says so; the Game Master moves on, since an off hand may still have something to do.
- **The tracker is extended, not replaced.** `ImagineCombatTracker` (`CONFIG.ui.combat`) adds each
  clock under its row after Foundry has drawn the tracker and puts a stopwatch in the header, so a
  Foundry change to the tracker's template does not have to be copied here. The row's bar and the
  window's rows share one partial, `imagine-clock-bar`. A double click on the clock is stopped at
  the clock, because two quick +1s would otherwise open the actor's sheet.
- **Attack cards spend once, on the right hand.** Weapon and creature cards record `hand`; Spend
  Seconds charges that pool, names the seconds for the weapon, and marks the card spent.

**Verified:** `tools/round-test.html` (87, new) -- the rules against the books' own examples (the
great sword carried two seconds and a reaction of 3 landing on the 5th second; a 5th-second start
costing the off hand two; "on second 8 ... only 3 seconds left, not 5"; a speed-3 weapon's three
swings with one second spare, p.174; the Master's Manual's -15 marker running 1a to 5b then 6), the view,
and the combat document driven through a stubbed Foundry for a whole fight: rolls through
`_preUpdate`, spends, undo, the round announced over, a typed initiative restarting a clock, and
`nextRound` carrying one action (reaction posted) and one late start while a third rolls afresh.
`tools/round-preview.html` renders the real templates. Every other suite passes unchanged (combat
503, derivation 507, creature 149, martial 154, and nine more); 67 modules listed, none with a syntax
error. Foundry API paths were checked against the V13 client source installed on this machine.
**Not verified:** anything in a running V14 -- the tracker subclass, the buttons, the carry roll's
chat card, and V14 keeping V13's permissive `_canChangeTurn`.

**Not built:** his chart's Surprise row (seconds gained by surprising, before initiative); Speed
effects setting `speedSeconds` by themselves (the potions and spells are Layer 4's); any timing for
casting or lore uses beyond spending their seconds by hand. See `docs/sonnet/2026-09-22-round-clock.md`.

## A poison used on someone, and a weapon mods window with his whole Customize panel (2026-09-22)

**Asked for directly**, after the question "do you have any rigging for what happens when you use a
potion, or when a poison is applied to a weapon?" (there was none): "2, also we need a pop up menu
for weapons to apply various other mods (blessed, etc)". Option 2 was a poison used against a
target. The user chose Opus, his whole weapon Customize panel, and ruled on Bless: **"bless is a
temp effect, not as in the holy +x weapons, what we ended up doing is making a custom weapon as a
2nd item for when it was pertinent."**

### A poison against a victim

His `doPoisonAction` (sheet-worker.js:135358) is ported as `resolvePoisonOnVictim` in
`module/lore-rules.mjs`, pure and dice-injected, and the tab's Use on a poison now asks who takes it:
the targeted tokens, the user's own character, or no one (a coating, a trap, a gift -- the dose is
spent and the description posted). Each victim rolls their own Poison Resistance with
`resolveResistanceRoll`, with an optional modifier, and the card gives his outcome: immune, the
type's "succeeds" clause, or its "fails" clause, with the potency's onset and the type's duration
rolled.

- **Durations are in minutes, following his row and the book, not his handler.** For types IV,
  VIII-XII and XX his `doPoisonAction` writes "Effects last 1d6=N hour(s)", where his own
  `getPoisonDetails` (135117) -- the text the poison carries on its row -- and the Master's Manual's
  table both say minutes. Two of his sources against one, and a handler that was plainly copied
  from the hours-long types above it. UPSTREAM 62.
- **Endurance damage over the duration is rolled, and labelled a convenience.** The Master's
  Manual says a poison's damage "applies to overall Endurance during the poison's duration"; his
  handler rolls the duration and leaves the per-interval damage to the table. The port rolls the
  whole of it (1d6 a minute for 3 minutes is 3d6) because otherwise the Game Master does that sum
  at the table every time, and says so on the card. **It is not applied.** Apply Damage works by
  body area; overall-Endurance damage has no button yet.
- A resisted half counts as resisted, as `resolveResistanceRoll` already says for every other track.

### The weapon mods window

A wand button on every weapon row (Combat tab and Equipment tab) opens `module/apps/weapon-mods.mjs`
over the pure `module/weapon-mods-view.mjs`; the rules are `module/weapon-custom-rules.mjs`, and the
data `module/weapon-custom-tables.mjs`, generated by `tools/extract/extract_weapon_custom_tables.py`
from his sheet HTML's customize selects and his worker's `checkWeaponCustomization` (81497),
`updateMagicPlus` (81461), `setMagicDamageDetails` (91318) and the divine and energy dice.

**For now -- temporary effects.** Stored on the weapon as `system.tempEffects`, each with an end in
world time (`game.time.worldTime`) or none. **Bless is one**, per the user's ruling and the Player's
Guide's Holy Weapon (Bless skill, p.118): +1 to hit and +1 damage for a good wielder, -1/-1 for an
evil one, for a day. The figures are the wielder's alignment's at the moment of the attack, not
fixed when blessed -- the book's rule is about who holds it. The Game Master can add their own, with
a to-hit, a damage and a span. Ended ones stop counting and are struck through until cleared.

**For good -- his panel**, the weapon half of his Equipment tab's CUSTOMIZE ITEMS (`customizeItem`,
78903): condition, quality, prefix and suffix, the magical plus or Blessed, base Aura and Piety
Control, magical and divine abilities, runes, energy and its dice, physical customizations (with
his suitability rules, and an unsuitable one listed but disabled with his reason), a spell or
invocation imbued, and the weight set or adjusted. His rules are kept: a magical plus clears quality
and condition; Blessed and a +N are one or the other (his permanent Blessed is the book's "gives up
1 WIL" version); a base Aura or Piety Control once set stays; a mode ability raises the plus by his
`updateMagicPlus`.

- **"A customized copy" is the user's table practice, made a button.** Apply to this weapon, or to
  a copy carried beside it, split off a stack when there is more than one (his panel's "No#"). With
  no prefix or suffix the copy is suffixed "(customized)" so the two can be told apart.
- **The name is never changed.** His panel renames the item ("Rune Sharpness:2 Long Sword") and his
  attack code reads the name back. Here the lore lists (Weapon Lore, Weapon Knowledge) find a
  weapon by its name, so renaming would break them; the customization is stored in `system.custom`
  and the prefix, suffix and tags are shown beside the name, on the row and the card.
- **What the attack does with it.** A rune of the attack's own kind adds its level to hit -- only 1
  when the weapon already has a magical plus, his "Rune + to hit can only stack 1 with magic +"
  (64583) -- and **+(level)d6+(level)** damage. A mode ability (Accuracy for missiles, Piercing
  thrusts, Sharpness cuts, Disruption smashes) adds (Aura/5)d6 plus the weapon's dice and Aura/5, and
  a natural roll of 21 - Aura/5 or better doubles the blow, x3 if already doubled. Foe Strike,
  energy, Bane and the divine abilities (brands, Divine Might, Rebuke's heart attack and stroke,
  Divine Wrath and Blast) are **written out on the card for the table**, not applied: each needs a
  Magic Resistance or a foe type the port cannot see.
- **Rune damage follows his dictionary, not his code.** His code adds the rune's level to the
  WEAPON's dice count (64973: a 1d8 sword with Rune 2 rolls 3d8) and adds the flat +level only
  inside the verbose listing (65040), so it is shown but never rolled. His rune dictionary and the
  tag his panel writes both say "+Nd6+N". The port uses d6 and the flat bonus. UPSTREAM 63.
- **The panel's choices change the weapon's figures, as his combat sheet does.** Found while
  checking what a condition does: his `setEquippedWeaponInCombatSheet` (83420) runs an equipped
  weapon through fifteen "listing changes" functions (89784-90480) -- a Chain Weapon has a die more,
  is two seconds slower and six inches longer; Serrated adds one a die and keeps a third of its
  strength; Dulling loses a die and smashes only; Master is +1 damage, a second quicker, +5% skills
  and +1 to hit; Worn is -2, a second slower, -5% and -1; a +3 is two seconds quicker and +10% skills.
  Without them most of the panel would be labels. They are generated into
  `WEAPON_LISTING_CHANGES` and `MAGIC_PLUS_LISTING` (78 rows and a ten-step ladder, exact to his
  lines) and applied by `getCustomizedWeapon`, which gives the weapon **as his combat sheet carries
  it** without storing anything: the attack (modes, damage dice, speed) and the Combat tab row read
  it, and the stored figures stay what the compendium or the Game Master set. The plus's own +N to
  hit and damage are already the attack's "Magic", and weight is `resolveEncumbrance`'s, so those
  rows are read and skipped. This also fills an older gap: a +N weapon was never quicker, though
  his is. **Doubling Blade** is read as his "Double Blade" -- his panel writes the one and his rules
  test for the other, so in his sheet it does nothing (UPSTREAM 64). Left out: Repair and
  Invulnerability turning the strength into "[R]"/"[I]", and the Gravity and Strenghthen runes'
  text-parsed figures.

**Tests.** New `tools/weapon-mods-test.html` (69): the extraction, suitability, the plus, Bless by
alignment and by the clock, the attack's extras, every special with scripted dice, applying and
removing his panel's choices, what each tag and plus does to a real weapon's figures, the view, and
the window and attack-card templates compiled and rendered against real weapons. `tools/lore-test.html` gains the poison-victim rules (117 now). Every
other suite unchanged (combat 503, derivation 507, martial 154, creature 149, round 87 and the
rest); every module parses. **Not verified:** anything in a running V14 -- the window's buttons
writing back, the copy, the poison dialog and targets.

**Not built:** see `docs/sonnet/2026-09-22-weapon-mods.md`.

## Martial arts: three of the user's rulings, built (2026-09-22)

The martial pass left five questions open. The user answered four of them, the first as "book"
(Spinning +2, its own entry above), and the next three are built here. Creatures are the fourth and
have their own entry.

**Martial Lore values take the book's time.** His `martiallorevalueslist` has no speed column, so
`MARTIAL_LORE_TIMING` in `martial-arts.mjs` is kept by hand from the Player's Guide (pp.97-98) and
the Master's Manual (p.101): Flip takes 2 seconds; a made Feather Block adds 1 second to the block it
joins, and a made Slam adds 2 to the throw. The other nine happen WITH what they go with (Combined
Attack takes the longer of its two attacks; Punch and Kick Throw are "simultaneous"; Martial Disarm
is a contest the book gives no time for) and add nothing. The Lore rows show the time, a Lore roll's
card says it, and a block or throw rolled while Feather Block or Slam is made prints its time with
the addition.

**A stance's bonuses to skills, saves and resistances apply while it is held, with toggles.** His
sheet prints them (the stance prose, and `mod_special`) and applies none; the user ruled they apply.
`MARTIAL_STANCE_BONUSES` holds every figure from his own prose, learned and mastered: Flow as water's
Dodge/Feint/Sidestep, Strike as wind's Critical/Focused Attack/Perfect Shot, Calm in the storm's
Parries/Disarm/Trap Weapon, AGL saves, Control Resistance, and its resistance bonus "against effects
which hold or affect movement", and the Drunken stance's combat skills and martial attacks. Two
conditions the sheet cannot see are the player's own figures on the martial panel: VIT saves failed
for intoxication (`system.martial.intoxication`), and whether a hold or movement effect is being
resisted now (`system.martial.resistingHold`). **A Drunken stance outside its window (1 to 3 failed
saves, 5 mastered) adds nothing at all, to-hit and damage included** -- the prose's "after failing 1
VIT Save ... If more than 3 ... all modifiers are lost" read as the whole stance, where his code applies
the to-hit regardless. It is still HELD, so it still bars Furious Attack and Desperate Defense.
The bonus lands on each skill item's `totalChance` and is recorded as `stanceBonus`; **the Arch Mortal
screen takes it back out**, since qualifying reads a skill as trained, not as boosted by whatever
stance is held. Because a skill's total can now move with the stance, `_prepareMartialArts` runs
BEFORE `_prepareOffhandSkills` rather than after: the Drunken stance's combat-skill bonus reaches
Second Weapon Knowledge, which is typed Combat.

**Martial Lore's blind fighting is the book's.** Per full 25%: +2 to hit, +1 damage, +5% to combat
skills (Player's Guide p.97), where his sheet gives +1 to hit and nothing else. The book gives the
to-hit to "melee and missile weapons", so the missile Situation Mods now read it too (his SET reads it
for melee only); See without eyes stays melee-only, being a melee stance, so a bow reads Martial
Lore's figure alone. The to-hit is an OFFSET held to the blindness penalty it offsets -- "the
practitioner does not gain additional bonuses once the blindness penalties are negated" -- so +12
against Blind's -8 comes to 0, not +4. The +5% combat skills lands on every skill typed Combat while
the blind Situation Mods are set, recorded as `blindBonus` and taken out for the Arch Mortal screen
as `stanceBonus` is. To carry blindness into a missile set, the missile Blind, Darkness and three
cannot-see options now carry his melee words ("Blind", "Can't See Target"); they add no No Defense
there, since his missile SET has none.

**A "Full Defensive Mod" keeps only a defence lost to blindness.** His handleMeleeSet clears the No
Defense override whatever caused it, so on his sheet a blind fighter who also critically failed a
Critical kept their defence. His own comment says what it is for ("a blind fighter ... who can hear
well enough to get defensive modifier anyway"), so a defence lost any other way stays lost. In
UPSTREAM-ISSUES item 56.

**The martial panel is now a partial**, `templates/actor/martial-panel.hbs`, registered as
`imagine-martial-panel` by `loadMartialTemplates` (the round clock's arrangement), so the creature's
Combat tab can include the same one.

Checked: martial 179 (25 new), combat 511 (8 new), derivation 507; both previews render the partial.
Not verified: the two new fields writing back, and the partial loading, in a running Foundry V14.

## Creatures get martial arts (2026-09-22)

The user's ruling on the fifth question: build it now. His creature sheet carries the same martial
section a character's does, reading Martial Knowledge and Martial Lore off the creature's own skill
list (`getCreatureSkillChance`), and his creature branches treat holding the skill at all as having
acquired it -- there is no title to reach.

**One derivation for both.** The body of the character's `_prepareMartialArts` moved into
`deriveMartialArts` in `martial-arts.mjs`, which both data models call; they differ only in where the
two chances come from and in laying the character-wide figures (defence, initiative, weapon speed,
`martialDefense`, `martialBlind`) onto their own combat block. The character's behaviour is unchanged
(martial 179 before and after). The creature's Situation Mods moved out of `_prepareCombat` into their
own `_prepareSituation`, after martial arts, so a creature's blind fighting and Immoveable Stance reach
them as a character's do.

**A creature's stance bonuses land on saves and resistances in derivation, and on a skill when it is
rolled.** A creature's skill chances are the entered figures themselves -- the sheet's inputs write
them -- so a derived bonus on them would be written back by the next save. The creature skill roll
and the Situation Mods window add `getStanceSkillBonus` at roll time instead. A creature's skills
carry no types, so the Drunken stance's "combat skills" bonus does not reach them; the by-name
bonuses (Dodge, Critical, the Parries) do.

**A creature's natural attack takes the martial MELEE to-hit only.** His `handleCreatureAttack` reads
`martial_arts_mod_melee` and `martial_stance_mod_melee` and nothing else of martial arts -- no damage,
no missile -- so that is what `creature-attack.mjs` adds: `getMartialAttackModifiers`' to-hit entries,
for a melee-kind attack, and Flip still forbidding the attack. Its martial ATTACKS (a Martial Punch
thrown by a creature) go through the same `rollMartialAttack` a character's do, which reads only what
both actor types have.

**The panel is the same partial**, included on the creature's Combat tab, with the same handlers on the
creature sheet. `tools/creature-preview.html` now gives its Cave Wyrm Martial Knowledge and Lore, a
Calm in the storm stance and a made Slam, and the Situation Mods bar (the Sonnet note's item 1 from the
Situation Mods pass).

Checked: creature 157 (8 new), martial 179, combat 511, derivation 507, 71 modules parse; the creature
preview renders the panel. Not verified: anything needing a running Foundry V14.

## Poison damage on overall Endurance, and poisoned weapons (2026-09-23)

The user ruled on the two poison items the weapon mods pass left open: **"Poison damage is applied to
OVERALL Endurance only"**, adding to the victim's total wounds (and so shock) and to no one body area,
and a poisoned weapon (a coating) is wanted.

### Poison damage

- **Where it goes.** A new stored `body.overallWounds` on both actor models, counted in the derived
  `totalWounds` by `_prepareBody` (and `inShock` now reads that total). Area wounds are untouched. It
  is damage "inside" the victim: no armour, hide, pain threshold or absorption touches it.
- **When it lands -- a reading.** The Master's Manual: the numbers "apply to overall Endurance during
  the poison's duration" (Effects of Poisons, p.103), each written per an interval. His
  `doPoisonAction` (sheet-worker.js:135358) writes the clause and rolls the duration and applies
  nothing; his sheet has no overall-Endurance figure. Read here as: nothing before the potency's onset,
  then one interval's damage **at the end of each interval** of the duration, so all of it has landed
  when the duration ends. `resolvePoisonOnVictim` now rolls and keeps each interval (`damage.rolls`,
  the same dice in the same order as before, so the total is unchanged).
- **The button.** Each victim whose poison deals damage gets "Apply to overall Endurance" on the
  poison card. The dialog offers the intervals the world clock says have landed since the dose was
  taken (`getPoisonIntervalsDue`), or everything left when the clock has not reached the first; the
  Game Master may apply any number. Guarded like the attack card's Apply Damage: the message counts
  what each victim has had applied, a finished victim's button is retired, only someone who can
  change the victim may apply, and only the author or the GM can write the count.

### A poisoned weapon

**His sheet has none.** No attribute, handler or tag in sheet-worker.js or the sheet HTML puts a poison
on a weapon; his poison USE spends a dose and rolls only the "on self" tick. So these are the books':

- **A coating is put on from the poison's Use** (the Magic & Lore tab), where his USE spends the dose:
  "Coat a weapon: <name>" beside targets / self / no one. The weapon mods window shows it and wipes it
  off (the dose is lost). Stored as `system.coating` { name, poisonType, poisonPotency, form, doses }.
- **Forms.** Ingestive "must be imbibed or introduced into the bloodstream", Contact "must contact the
  skin", Gaseous "must be inhaled" (MM p.103; PG p.136). A gas cannot coat a weapon. His MM errata
  (p.291, Venom) calls a wound-delivered poison "insinuative"; that is not a form on his sheet and the
  port adds none.
- **An Envenomed blade -- the book's rule, exactly.** Mysteries of the Planes p.175 (his panel's
  "Envenomed" customization): the hilt holds up to 5 doses, and "when the weapon thrusts into a target
  and does 10 or more actual damage, then 1 dose of poison is applied". Cost paid is not recorded, so 5
  is the cap.
- **A plain coating -- a reading, no book rule.** One dose, delivered by the first hit that does
  actual flesh damage (1 or more past armour, hide and absorption) in any mode, and spent. A blow the
  armour stops entirely leaves it on: neither form reaches skin or blood. The 10-point threshold is
  the Envenomed mechanism's (and the PG's "stuck" threshold for thrusts), not applied to a smear on an
  edge. A second dose of the same poison on a coated plain weapon is refused (it adds nothing), and a
  different poison waits until the first is wiped.
- **Delivery.** `applyAttackDamage` reads the weapon's coating as it is now (a coating another hit
  spent is not spent twice), runs `resolveCoatingDelivery` on the flesh damage, and on delivery takes
  the dose off the weapon and posts a poison card for the target through the same
  `postPoisonOnVictims` / `resolvePoisonOnVictim` as a poison used from the tab, Apply button included.
  Spending it needs the right to change the attacker's weapon; without it the card says to have the
  Game Master apply the hit. The attack card says the weapon is poisoned.

Also in this pass, at the main session's request: `rollWeaponAttack` passes
`maximize: tmpsitmods.maxDamage` to `resolveWeaponSpecials`.

Tests: lore 138 (21 new), weapon mods 73 (4 new); combat 520, derivation 507, creature 157, martial
179, round 87 unchanged; 71 modules parse. **Not verified:** anything in a running V14 -- the Apply
button, the coat option, the delivery card, and the flag writes. `overallWounds` is not yet shown or
editable on either sheet, so healing it needs a sheet change (see `docs/sonnet/2026-09-23-poison-damage.md`).

## The round clock's Surprise row, and the live clock on the Combat tab (2026-09-23)

**Asked for:** both approved by the user -- his chart's Surprise row, and the note's item 3 (the round
clock beside the Off-Hand Seconds box).

**Where the rules come from.** His Roll20 sheet has no surprise seconds anywhere: its surprise is the
situational `sit_surprise_normal` (+4 to hit, +6 damage) and the Surprise Attack roll that sets it
(sheet-worker.js:17588, 19934-20045). So this is the books': 1d4+1 seconds of unanswered action
before initiative (Player's Guide p.168; p.169 Surprise Bonuses; Master's Manual p.93, Sequence of
Combat II-III), and his chart's "Surprise (pre-combat round)" row used as "a mini round" (Master's
Manual p.100). The errata only corrects the Surprise Base table (Agility 29-30 is 100%), which is the
roll to gain surprise, not what it gives.

**Readings I had to make, and why:**

- **Five seconds at most.** 1d4+1 is 2-5, and a Surprise Attack critical success makes it "the full 5
  seconds" (Master's Manual p.71, Critical Success). The Game Master can still set any figure from 1 to
  5, or roll once for a group (p.93's "simplest way") or once each (its Advanced GM note).
- **Surprise is a phase before round 1, kept apart from the clock.** It lives in
  `flags.imagine-rpg.surprise` (`{ seconds, spent, carryOver }`), not in the round-keyed clock, so a
  roll or a reset of initiative never touches it and the settled clock shape is unchanged. p.93 says
  surprisers and victims roll initiative only after the surprise, "they will not lose those seconds
  until after the initial surprise time has been used" -- so round 1's clock simply starts when the
  surprise ends. The Game Master ends it ("End surprise"); like the round, it is announced used up,
  never ended automatically. Ending it starts the combat if it had not been started, since "the combat
  round begins" then. Next Round ends a surprise left running, first.
- **An action running past the surprise carries into round 1** with the ordinary Carry-Over rule
  (p.168): no initiative until it finishes, then a reaction roll added to its last second, rolled when
  the surprise ends and posted as nextRound posts one. The books do not say this of surprise; it is the
  only rule they have for an action cut off by the end of a period of seconds, and the chart calls the
  surprise a round. Declinable, like any carry.
- **Unspent surprise seconds are lost** when it ends. The book gives them "to begin attacking before
  Initiative is rolled" and has the surpriser roll "after he has used his free seconds"; nothing lets
  them be kept.
- **Off-hand spends during surprise are recorded and cost nothing.** The off hand acts alongside the
  main hand in a round (p.178); the surprise's seconds are the ceiling for both.
- **Speed seconds do not split surprise seconds.** Extra seconds are a round's (Master's Manual p.100);
  nothing says a surprise has them.
- **Not built:** victims are not marked (they only wait, which the surprise already models), and
  per-victim surprise ("who gains unanswered seconds against who", p.93) is left to the table. A
  surprise in the middle of a round (p.168) is spent as ordinary seconds on the clock.
- **While a combatant has surprise, the same buttons act on it.** The tracker row and the window row
  draw the surprise in the shared bar (one cell per surprise second, under seconds 1-5), and
  spendSeconds/undoSeconds/setCarryOver go to the surprise -- so an attack card's Spend Seconds does too.
  A surpriser still spending sorts above the round.

**The Combat tab.** The Off-Hand Seconds box shows the off hand's "3 of 5" and "left this round", and
the main hand's status line ("Second 7 · 4 left", or where the surprise stands), while the actor is in
the combat the tracker is viewing; the allowance otherwise. The creature tab had no such box and now has
one (its `offhandSecondsCap` was already derived). Read-only. The actor's combatant is found by the actor
itself first (a token's synthetic actor), then by id for a linked actor, as `findCombatant` does. It
redraws from the tracker's `_onRender`, the way the window does: `refreshActorSheetClocks` re-renders
the Combat part of every open sheet that shows the clock or showed it last time (so leaving the combat
clears it). No hooks of its own.

**Verified:** `tools/round-test.html` 123 (36 new: the rules, the views, the sheet box, and an ambush
through the stubbed combat document -- give, spend, over-run, undo, carry toggle, end, reaction roll 3
landing on the 5th second as the book's example does). Combat 520, derivation 507, creature 157, martial
179 unchanged; 71 modules parse. `tools/round-preview.html` renders an ambush in the tracker and window.
**Not verified:** anything in a running V14 -- the Surprise dialog, `startCombat` from End surprise, the
sheets redrawing from the tracker, and the flag set to null clearing the surprise.

## Weapon mods: three leftovers from the hand-off note, built (2026-09-23)

**A weapon's own skills modifier reaches the Situation Mods skill rolls.** His
`setTotalWeaponSkillMod` (sheet-worker.js:98621) totals the chosen weapon's `weaponN_skills_mod`, its
off-hand penalty and its lore bonus for Critical, Focused Attack, Perfect Shot and the rest. The
Situation Mods window had the last two; it now adds `getCustomizedWeapon(...).skillsMod` (his Arm
Blade's +20%, a +3's +10%). No other roll in the port reads a weapon's skills modifier, because his
only other reader is the weapon parry roll, which the port does not have yet.

**Maximum damage maximizes a weapon's MAGICAL dice too.** His `setMagicDamageDetails` gives the mode
ability's and Foe Strike's dice their highest under "Max" (91530, 91609) and rolls energy and divine
dice as usual. `resolveWeaponSpecials` takes `maximize` and does exactly that.

**The rest of his listing changes.** A Gravity rune moves speed, minimum speed and damage dice by one
per full 30% of weight (neither speed under 1), and its weight reaches encumbrance -- with the rune's
own direction rather than his arithmetic's, UPSTREAM 66. A Gravity rune's level is signed, as his is.
Strenghthen Metal/Wood adds +5 weapon strength, +10 for the greater rune; Repair makes the strength
"[R]" and Invulnerability (ability or rune) "[I]". combat-test +9.

## A preview's fixed die is a 1, and a die-indexed pick is held to its list (2026-09-23)

**Found at a real table on 0.18.1.** With "Gear by culture" ticked the character generator would not
leave Details: the Review step's redraw threw "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading
'armorClothing')" at `rollWildernessKit`. The Review preview (`chargen-view.mjs`, @MARKER REVIEW) called
`assembleCharacter` with a fixed die of `() => 0`. Every rule here takes its dice as `tmpRoll(sides) ->
1..sides` (the headers of `chargen-rules.mjs` and `lore-rules.mjs`); a 0 read `tmpAlternatives[-1]`. 61 of
the 111 races with a culture kit failed that way with nothing rolled, and most of the rest would at a
higher social class. The real in-Foundry die (`ImagineCharacterGenerator.#die`) was never wrong.

**Two calls, both small:**

1. **A fixed die for a preview is `() => 1`, never `() => 0`.** It stays inside the contract and matches
   the Details step's kit preview, which already used 1, so Review lists the kit Details showed. A fixed
   die is kept at all for the reason the kit preview gives: a list that reshuffled on every redraw would
   be worse than none. The kit actually given is still rolled once, at creation.
2. **`rollWildernessKit` holds its die to 1..n**, the same way it already held the social class to the
   ends of the band list, and returns an issue rather than throwing if a choice is missing. A preview
   should never be able to take the whole window down. Picks made by an in-contract die are unchanged:
   checked against all 85 bands that offer a choice, every face 1..n.

**Not done here, recorded so it is not lost:** the same unguarded `list[tmpRoll(n) - 1]` shape remains
in `lore-rules.mjs` (hymn, poison and primer picks, and `drawDistinct`, whose loop has no guard). Its only
production caller passes an in-contract die, so no user can reach it today; the hardening is listed in
`docs/sonnet/2026-09-23-chargen-kit-crash.md`. The preview showing the FIRST kit while creation rolls
among them is a known trade-off, not a bug, and is left as it was.

**Verified:** `tools/chargen-test.html` 89 (+6: faces 1..4 pick as before; 0, 10 and NaN are held to
the ends; every race at social -2..25 with dice 0/1/10/NaN), `tools/derive-test.html` 510 (+2: the Review
redraw for every race with a culture kit, all three kit rules ticked, and its list holds the Details
preview). A node sweep of every race at social -2..25 through the Review view threw 4,858 times on
0.18.1 and 0 now. **Not verified:** the window in a running V14.

## 2026-09-23 — Natural weapons are weapons, and a race brings them

**Asked for directly:** "please ensure that races that get natural weapons have them on the sheet by
default." Then, when offered the choice: *"I very much do want them in the weapons section up with all
the other equipment. I think it's odd that they get added elsewhere. If the player doesn't want them,
they can remove them."*

**What the port had:** nothing. A race carried an ability label, "Natural Weapons(Saurian)", whose
description is only "gains additional natural weapon attacks in combat". The attacks themselves live
in one switch of his, `setRacialNaturalAttacks` (sheet-worker.js:100946-102126), which writes up to ten
numbered slots per race (name, type, speed, minimum, damage, special). Nothing had read it.

**What is built:**
- `tools/extract/extract_natural_attacks.py` walks the switch into
  `src/packs/named/naturalAttacks.json`: **49 races, 97 attacks**, cross-checked against his own
  `natural_attacks_list` for every race and branch, with no mismatches. It also walks `getPoisonByTitle`.
- `build_documents.py` makes each one a **weapon** named "<race> <attack>" ("Saurian Claws"), type
  `Natural`, weight 0, equipped. It lists them on the race in a new `naturalWeapons` field and gives each
  one its race's book and page. The result is **95 weapons across 48 races**. His `case "Sasquatch"`
  names no race; every other table of his uses "Sasquatch/Yeti", which has its own case. Its two
  weapons are reported and not shipped.
- `module/natural-weapons.mjs`: the generator adds them with the race (`assembleCharacter`), and a
  `createItem` hook adds them when a race is dropped on a character. Nothing is removed, and nothing
  already held by that name is given twice, so a deleted claw stays deleted.
  `game.imagine.grantNaturalWeapons(actor)` covers characters made before this.

**Why a weapon and not a separate block:** the user's call, above. His roll agrees with it, too.
`handleNaturalAttack` (69996) rolls a d20 down the attack chart with Strength to hit and the damage
modifiers on top, which is the weapon attack. The port's `creatureAttack` item was the other candidate
and was not used, because it would have put claws in a place of their own.

**Rules carried from his switch:**
- **Which body.** "Half races set body by the first race" (100947), so a Half Race takes the first
  race's weapons. A Formless takes its host's, never its own.
- **Physique.** The Apocritara's Stinger is in the slight branch only. The generator knows the physique
  and decides it. The actor stores no physique, so a race dropped on a sheet gives only the unbranched
  attacks, and the Stinger is left in the pack to drag.
- **Speed.** Where he shortens the speed (`tmpSpeed=tmpSpeed+combatModSpeed+stanceSpeedMod`, floored
  at `tmpMinSpeed`), the weapon keeps his speed and minimum. That is what a weapon's speed already does.
  Where he fixes the speed, the minimum is set to the speed. The Mephyts' Heat and Cold Skin write a
  lower minimum his code never reaches, and that figure is dropped. His `"S"` (Centaur Trample,
  Gryphara Raking Claws) is `speedSpecial`.
- **Se'eth venom by title.** His card appends `getPoisonByTitle(title)`. The description carries the
  whole 1-15 table, since a weapon's text does not change as its owner advances.

**Departures, each written into the weapon's own description:**
- His type is only a label on his card. A weapon's mode sets its damage type, so each type takes the
  nearest mode: Cut→cut, Pierce→thrust, Smash→smash, Pierce/Smash→both. Crush and Constrict become
  smash, because a weapon has neither mode.
- **Touch** (Brok's Harm Touch, and the Mephyts' Heat and Cold Skin) is rolled in his sheet as a touch:
  d20 plus the Agility modifier, 10 or better. The weapon attack rolls it down the chart instead. It is
  left in `docs/sonnet/2026-09-23-natural-weapons.md`.
- His `getNaturalAttackLost` (a lost limb loses its attack) is not ported. It is in the same note.

**Not done:** Famorian. Its attacks come from its evokes (`setFamorianNaturalAttacks`) and want their
own pass, which is also in the note.

**Verified:** `tools/natural-weapons-test.html` 22 of 22, against the real documents. `chargen-test`
89/89, `derive-test` 510, `combat-test` 520, `importer-test` 9, all passing. `syntax-check` clean
with the new module listed. **Not verified:** a running V14. Not released either: the tree held
another session's unfinished work when this was done.

## Starting money is rolled, on the user's three rulings (2026-09-23)

**Reported as "sheet not generating currency for character creation."** It was not a regression: it
had never been built. The 2026-09-20 entry earlier in this file held it back ("Starting money is not guessed at")
because one line in his `setCoins` could not be ported without a decision. Reading the function again
turned up two more such lines, and the book's own table (Player's Guide p.207, an image the text
extraction had dropped, read off the PDF this time) settled what it could. All three went to the user
together and were ruled on the same day:

1. **The Fortune roll is made at or under Fortune** (UPSTREAM 40). His line succeeds on a d100 at or
   ABOVE it. The book says only "Make a Fortune roll… If the roll is successful", and every Fortune
   roll elsewhere succeeds at or under. Taken as a slip; still open with him. `checkStartingFortune`
   holds the comparison alone, with his literal reading written beside it as a comment, so his answer
   is a one-line change either way.
2. **Nobles get the book's x5 and x10** (UPSTREAM 67). His `tempcoins*5;` computes and discards. The
   multiplication is written, and the book's table has it, so it is applied: a King's family gets
   (10d20)x10 platinum, not 10d20. **This goes against "the sheet wins"** in the plain sense: his sheet
   as it runs pays a fifth or a tenth. The call is the user's, made because the sheet's own text
   says x5/x10 and only fails to assign it. Compare the kit fall-throughs (UPSTREAM 42), which ARE
   reproduced: nothing in that code says what else was meant.
3. **The Fortune rolled against is the character's whole Fortune** (UPSTREAM 68): the average of
   AUR/PTY/WIL rounded up, +5 for "+5% Fortune", +1 for the first title (none for a GME), and the race
   modifier. That is his `changeCharacteristics` (30333). His `setCoins` fetches the race modifier and
   never adds it, and misnames the field it tests for the class bonus, so on his sheet neither ever
   applies.

**Where it lives.** `module/starting-money.mjs`, Foundry-free, beside `starting-kit.mjs`. It is not in
`chargen-rules.mjs`, where the 2026-09-20 note proposed it, only because another session was editing
that file at the same time. The table is written in by hand rather than extracted: sixteen rows, each
checked in the tests against the book's printed range for its row.

**When it rolls.** By itself, the first time the generator's Details step is drawn with a race,
attributes and a class chosen. His sheet rolls it by itself too, when the racial features are
confirmed, with no button. The port waits for the class because rule 3 needs it (his sheet rolls before
the class is chosen, so on his sheet the class bonus could not have applied even with the field name
right). It rolls again only if the Social Class or Fortune it was rolled from has changed since, i.e.
the player went back and made a different character. His sheet does the same: confirming the features
again clears the money and rolls afresh (`clearMoneyEquipmentValues`, 6438).

**No re-roll button, on purpose,** for the reason handedness and the Famorian breed have none: a button
that re-rolls until the multiplier comes up x10 is the same as choosing it. The four coin fields stay
editable, because the book lets the Game Master "alter the resources available to starting characters"
(p.207). The roll goes to chat, so the record of what was rolled stays there whatever the fields say
later.

**Gear by culture is taken instead of coins,** as its label always said and nothing enforced. While it
is ticked the coin fields are replaced by a note, nothing is rolled, and the character is created with
no coins. A field that would be quietly ignored at creation is worse than no field. Unticking it brings
back the coins already rolled, without a new roll: that is his `override_no_coins`, which keeps money
already there (6816).

**One apparent Social Class, not two.** A class below 5 or above 20 rolls an apparent one (5d4), in the
money and in the starting kit alike. Rolled separately, one character could look like a slave to its
purse and a noble to its tailor. So the kit is handed the money's apparent class (`getKitSocialClass`),
which the 2026-09-20 kit entry already required ("rolled ONCE by the caller").

**Found on the way and NOT fixed here:** the character sheet's own Fortune has neither the +1 per title
nor the class's "+5% Fortune". Perception (+1 per title, "+5% Perception") and Affinity (+2 per title,
"+5% Affinity") have the same gap. `titleBonus` is only ever written for Endurance
(`advancement.mjs`), and the Active Effects `item-class.mjs` says carry `classMods` were never
created. So a Mage's generator Fortune (his whole calculation) is 6 higher than the Fortune its sheet
shows. That is a gap in the actor model, not in the money, and is flagged for its own pass.

**Verified:** `tools/starting-money-test.html` 44 of 44: every row's lowest and highest roll against
the book's printed range, both rulings, the multiplier ladder, apparent class, the Fortune terms, and
the generator (when it is due, that it stands, the re-roll on a changed character, Gear by culture both
ways, the created actor's wealth, the Review line, one apparent class). `tools/chargen-test.html` 89 of
89, unchanged. `tools/syntax-check.html` clean. The Details step was drawn from the real template with a
rolled Mage: Gold 72 and the one-line account under it. **Not verified:** the window in a running V14,
including the chat card.

## Perception, Affinity and Fortune take their title and class bonuses, worked out (2026-09-23)

Found while building starting money: his `changeCharacteristics` (30279-30348) adds +1 Perception,
+2 Affinity and +1 Fortune per title (from the first; a GME's title 0 gets none, 8145-8158), and 5
for a class's "+5 Endurance" / "+5% Perception" / "+5% Affinity" / "+5% Fortune". The port added
neither: `titleBonus` was only ever written for Endurance, and the Active Effects `item-class.mjs`
said would carry `classMods` were never made. A title-1 Mage's Fortune read 6 short.

**Worked out, not stored**, by the user's go-ahead on the recommended option: the title term is
`title x rate` each time the character is prepared, and the class term is read off the class text his
way. Storing and raising them, as his `class_title_*` fields do, would have needed a migration for
every character already made, and a stored copy can drift from the title. Endurance keeps its stored
`titleBonus`, because that one is rolled. Shown on the model as `titleAdd` and `classMod`.
`derive-test` 517 (+7). This also makes the sheet's Fortune agree with the one the generator's
money roll uses (`getStartingFortune`).

## His money panel on the Equipment tab (2026-09-23)

Asked for by the user from a paste of his Loose Equipment panel. `module/wealth-rules.mjs` ports it:
Wealth(in Gold) is platinum x10 + gold + silver/10 + copper/100 (each coin rounded down on its own, his
`parseInt`) + every gem and jewelry entry at count x value (`getGemValue`, 26523), and the Update
Coins / Gems / Jewelry rows add and subtract (12691-13240), refusing to take what is not there, and
report to chat in his words.

**No data change.** Gems and jewelry stay in `system.wealth.gems` / `.jewelry` as his comma-separated
"<count> <name> w/<value>" strings, so the Description tab's text fields are untouched and a line typed
there is read the same way. The Equipment tab shows them; the Description tab still edits them.

**One departure:** his match for an existing entry is a substring test, so taking "Ruby w/50" could
hit "3 Ruby w/500". Here the name and value are compared exactly. A comma in a jewelry name is turned
into a space, since the comma separates entries. `tools/wealth-test.html` 22.

## Starting money can be rolled on the sheet, once (2026-09-23)

Reported on 0.19.1 at a real table: "still not generating currency". The served 0.19.1 archive was
checked and does contain the generator's roll; what it cannot do is reach a character the generator
never made -- one made before 0.19.0, or a blank one from Foundry's Create Actor button. His own sheet
does all of creation on the sheet, money included, so a player expects the sheet to roll it.

The Equipment tab's wealth panel now offers **Roll starting money** (`canRollStartingMoney`,
`getCharacterMoneyInputs` in `module/starting-money.mjs`): the generator's own roll, from the final
Social Class and the Fortune of the character's FIRST day (first title only, whatever it has reached
since). Offered only while the purse is empty -- coins, gems and jewelry; a Special note does not
count -- and only once for a player: the roll is recorded in `flags.imagine-rpg.startingMoney`, which
the generator now writes on every character it makes (the roll's line, or "Gear by culture, taken
instead of coins"). The Game Master may roll for any empty purse, which is how a wrong roll is put
right. The no-re-roll rule is the generator's, for the generator's reason. starting-money-test 59.
