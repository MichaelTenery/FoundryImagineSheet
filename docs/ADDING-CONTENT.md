# Adding Content

How to add races, classes, skills, weapons, armour, equipment, abilities, disabilities and
immunities to the Imagine RPG system, whether it is your own homebrew, material from a book that
is not in the system yet, or a correction to something that is. None of it needs a code change.

There are two routes. Use the first for your own table. Use the second for content that should ship
with the system for everyone.

| | In Foundry | In the content files |
|---|---|---|
| For | a Game Master's own campaign | content shipped with the system |
| Needs | nothing but Foundry | Python, and a rebuild |
| Survives a content re-import | yes, if kept in your own compendium | yes, it is part of the build |
| Can change a stock entry | no, make a copy under a new name | yes, with `"_override": true` |

---

## Route 1: in Foundry

1. **Make a compendium of your own.** In the Compendium tab, create a compendium of type Item, for
   example "Our Campaign". Keep your content there, not in the system's own "Imagine ..." compendiums.
2. **Create the item** in it, of the right type:

   | to add a... | item type | notes |
   |---|---|---|
   | skill | Skill | category is class, racial or social |
   | weapon, armour, piece of gear | Weapon / Armour / Equipment | |
   | race | Race | a character with TWO race items is a Half Race, the two combined as his sheet combines them |
   | class | Class | a class with a choice (element, Call of Life/Death...) is one item per path |
   | ability, disability, immunity | Trait | set its category |
   | creature attack, creature power | Creature Attack / Power | creature-only |

3. **Set the Sourcebook field**, for example "Custom" or your campaign's name. Every sourcebook any
   compendium cites turns up by itself as a switch in **Game Settings → Configure Settings → Content Availability**. That is
   how a Game Master turns a whole body of homebrew off, or keeps a campaign to the published books.
4. **Drag it onto a character** as you would any stock item.

**Do not edit the system's own compendium entries.** Re-importing content (`game.imagine.importContent()`,
which is how a corrected sheet from the developer is brought in) updates those entries by name and
overwrites your changes. To change a stock entry, duplicate it into your own compendium under a new
name. To stop the stock one being used, forbid it in the content settings (its override key is
`type:Name`, for example `class:Warrior`).

**Known gap:** the Race and Class item sheets do not yet let you edit their list fields: racial
skills, abilities, fertile races, blocked races, and a class's skill list. Until they do (see
`docs/sonnet/2026-09-18-races-classes.md`, item 1), author those through Route 2.

## Route 2: in the content files

Every pack has a hand-authored file in `src/packs/manual/`:

```
abilities.json  armor.json  classes.json  disabilities.json  equipment.json
immunities.json  races.json  skills.json  weapons.json
```

Each has the same shape, and each carries a worked `_example` to copy from:

```json
{
  "_about": "notes -- any key starting with _ is never read as content",
  "entries": {
    "Knot Craft": { "attr1": "AGL", "attr2": "INT", "skillRating": 12, "category": "class" },
    "Climb":      { "_override": true, "description": "Only the fields given are changed." }
  }
}
```

Then rebuild the documents and re-import them:

```bash
python tools/extract/build_documents.py --write
```

and in Foundry, as the Game Master: `game.imagine.importContent()`.

**The rules** (`apply_manual_content` in `tools/extract/build_documents.py`):

- **A new name is added.** Give only the fields that matter; the rest take the schema's defaults
  when it is imported.
- **Unless you give a sourcebook, it is tagged "Custom"**, so all of it shares one switch in the
  content settings.
- **A name the developer's data already builds is ignored, and reported**, unless the entry says
  `"_override": true`. Then only the fields you give are laid over his, field by field. A list
  replaces a list whole. Every override is reported on every build. His sheet is the source of truth,
  so changing it has to be done out loud.
- **A class that is the base of several paths** (Elemental Dancer, of Elemental Dancer(Water) and the
  rest) cannot be overridden as a whole. Override each path by its own name.
- **A misspelt field is reported**, checked against the item's schema, rather than silently dropped
  on import.
- **A key starting with `_` is a note**, beside your entries as well as inside one, so you can leave
  yourself a line about where a weight came from without it being read as an item.

A worked entry, and the one the system ships with -- a crowbar, which his sheet has no equivalent
of. Its weight is anchored to his own figures (Pick(Digging) 5, Shovel 6, Tongs(Large) 5) rather
than to anything outside them, so encumbrance reads consistently:

```json
"entries": {
  "_weights": "Anchored to his equipvalueslist: Pick(Digging) 5, Shovel 6, Tongs(Large) 5.",
  "Crowbar": { "weight": 5, "description": "A three-foot iron bar, flattened and split at one end." }
}
```

`--check` in place of `--write` reports all of this without writing anything.

**What the fields are:** the item's data model in `module/data/item-<type>.mjs` declares every
field, with a comment on each. The generated documents in `src/packs/documents/` show real values
for every one.

---

## Route 3: saying which book something came from

A sourcebook and page are not content, so they have a file of their own: **`src/packs/manual/sources.json`**.

```json
"entries": {
  "Nixie":     { "sourcebook": "Legends of the Unknown", "page": "33" },
  "Stonefolk": { "sourcebook": "Aspects of the Wild",    "page": "12" }
}
```

Keyed by the document's exact name, for any pack. It **wins over everything else**, including the
generated `src/packs/named/itemSources.json` — which is built from the Master Index by
`extract_sources.py` and, for a great many entries, names the Index itself rather than the book the
thing came from. Someone who has looked it up in the actual book knows better, so their answer wins.

Do not hand-edit `src/packs/named/itemSources.json` for this: it is generated too, and re-running
the extractor throws the edits away.

`docs/UNATTRIBUTED.md` lists everything still marked `XXX`, and is rewritten by every build, so it
is the worklist.

## Which is the source of truth

**His errata first, then the Roll20 sheet, then the books** — see `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/ERRATA.md`;
the errata was ranked above the sheet on 2026-09-21.

Everything in `src/packs/documents/` is **generated**, and nothing there should be edited by hand:
the next build overwrites it without warning, and that is not a hypothetical — it is what would
have happened to the race attribution contributed on 2026-09-21, which is why Route 3 exists.
Hand content lives only in `src/packs/manual/` (Routes 2 and 3) or in your own compendiums
(Route 1). His data is never changed except by an `_override` that says so on every build.

**Not verified:** Route 1 depends on Foundry V14's own item creation and compendium tools, which
have not yet been exercised against this system in a running V14 install. Route 2 is tested
(`build_documents.py --check` against every example).
