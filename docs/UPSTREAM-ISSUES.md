# Upstream Issues — findings for the original developer

Defects and open questions found in the Roll20 sheet while porting it. These are **his** sheet, not ours, so nothing here has been silently patched — the conversion works around them and records them for him to confirm or fix.

Status: `open` (not yet raised) / `raised` (passed to him) / `answered` / `fixed upstream`.

---

## 1. `Monk` class row is one column short — affects the live sheet

**Status:** ANSWERED 2026-09-16, fix confirmed · **Severity:** real bug, currently visible in play

**His answer:** *"sounds like the right fix"* — insert one empty `classMod` slot after index 14.
The port now corrects the Monk row on build rather than leaving the class unbuildable, and reports
that it did.

`classRequirementsAndDetails["Monk"]` has **21 columns**; all 87 other classes have 22. Monk carries only 4 `classMod` slots (indices 11–14) where every other class has 5 (11–15). Every field after that point is shifted left by one.

Because `classDetails[16]` is read as armour usage (sheet-worker.js:51018), and Monk's index 16 holds the *weapon* list, **Monk's armour usage currently displays weapon data**. Later fields (`classModifier`, `titleName`, `attribQualify`, `casting`) are all shifted too.

Monk, index 11 onward:
```
11 "+30% to core skills"
12 "+10% to divine skills"
13 "+5% to combat skills"
14 ""                          <- only 4 mod slots; others have 5
15 "Any leather/hide. Any half shirt..."   <- armour usage, should be index 16
16 "Bola, bow, cat's claws, club..."       <- weapon usage, should be index 17
```

Likely fix is inserting one empty `classMod` slot after index 14, but that's his call to confirm — guessing means altering game data.

## 2. `"Gaunt"` race carries a live expression where every other race has a literal

**Status:** open · **Severity:** question, may be intentional

`raceStatsAndMoveDetails["Gaunt"]` contains `0-getDieRoll(4)` — a function call embedded in the data. It is the **only** non-literal value across all 12,595 extracted dictionary entries.

If it's intentional (a race whose stat is randomised per character), the Foundry port needs to model it as a roll rather than a fixed value. If it's a leftover from debugging, it should be a literal. Needs his answer either way.

## 3. Is this sheet the current ruleset?

**Status:** open · **Severity:** blocking for bulk extraction confidence

He described `getArmorCombatValues` from memory rather than sending the file, so it's not confirmed whether `sheet-worker.js` as extracted reflects his present intended rules or a version he has since moved past. ~12,595 data rows are being taken from it.

## 4. "Made by half" vs the ±20% critical rule

**Status:** open · **Severity:** rules clarification

His attribute-save handlers compute `halfChance = chance / 2` and report a distinct "succeeded by half" tier (sheet-worker.js:47). The Player's Guide (p.93) instead defines critical success/failure as beating or missing by more than 20%.

These are different mechanics. Possibly saves and skills genuinely use different rules — needs confirming which applies where. His code wins regardless; the question is only scope.

## 5. Data edge cases found while converting 2,814 entries

**Status:** open · **Severity:** minor, mostly rules clarifications

The conversion runs 99.75% clean. These seven entries do not convert to a plain value and currently degrade to a default. None is urgent, but each wants a one-line answer:

| Entry | Field | Value | Question |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Sense Supernatural` | skill rating | `"Special"` | How is a skill with no numeric rating resolved? |
| `Garrote` | cut mode | `"S"` | Situational cut, as with its speed? |
| `Centaur` | jumpStand / jumpUp | `"Half"` | Half of the normal jump distance, presumably? |
| `Gaunt` | startEnduranceMod | `0-getDieRoll(4)` | Same as item 2 above — random by design? |

**Resolved without needing input** (recording them so the reasoning is visible):
- `"S"` in an armour coverage slot means the value comes from the material rather than the piece (giant chitin/scales/leather gauntlets). Preserved as a `coverageFromMaterial` list rather than flattened to 0, since a 0 would falsely claim the piece offers no protection there. Resolving them properly needs the giant-material rules.
- `"S"` as a weapon speed means no ordinary swing timing — lances, caltrops, garrotes. Now a `speedSpecial` flag.
- ~~Parenthesised values are a dual-headed weapon's second head.~~ **Corrected 2026-09-11:** parenthesised *damage* is a different damage in one attack mode (a Spear thrown, an Axe Hammer thrusting), and parenthesised *speed* is reload time for launched weapons (a Crossbow is `1(15)`). See `DECISIONS.md`.
- Composite flexibility (`Rigid/Flexible`, `Rigid/Semi-Flexible`, `Rigid/Rigid`, `Mixed`) is the data encoding of the built-in-padding rule, which lets a rigid piece with a flexible inner face sit against the body. `Rigid/Rigid` is legitimate too: "a few suits allow two sections of rigid armor because they do not touch."

## 6. Bugs found in his combat code

**Status:** open · **Severity:** real bugs; each defeats its own evident intent

Found while porting combat. In each case the Foundry port implements what the code was clearly *meant* to do, and the difference is listed here so he can confirm or correct it.

| # | Where | What happens | Effect in play | Port does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| a | `getArmorDamage` (sheet-worker.js:118851) | Walks the *area's* armour list but reads names from the character's *full* equipped list by the same index (`tempEquippedArmorAndClothingArray[i]` instead of `tempAreaEquippedArmorArray[i]`). | The wrong armour piece's material can set how fast armour degrades. | Uses the armour actually covering the struck area. |
| b | same | The magic check is `!tempAreaEquippedArmorArray.includes("+")`. On an array, `includes` compares whole elements, so it is only true if an element is exactly `"+"` -- never. | Magical armour is degraded like mundane armour, which the comment says must not happen. | Magical armour is not degraded. |
| c | `getArmorValue` is declared twice (lines 104551 and 118903) | A later function declaration silently replaces an earlier one with the same name. | The first version -- which reads an armour *item's* value, including the rule that "S" means "take the number after the colon" for giant materials -- is dead code. Anything calling it gets the material-rank version instead. | Uses the second, as JavaScript does. The first's intent is noted for when giant materials are ported. |
| d | `handleIntiativeUpdate` (line 69035) | `tmpCombatModInitINT=parseInt(values.combat_mod_init_agl)` reads Agility into the Intelligence variable. | When a martial stance changes, Intelligence is never considered for initiative. His main initiative path (line 82366) is correct. | The better of Agility and Intelligence, as the book and his main path say. |
| e | `createBodyAreas` (line 180218) | Tests `"x1/2"` before `"x1/20"`, and `"x1/20"` contains `"x1/2"`. | An area marked x1/20 gets half Endurance instead of a twentieth. No stock body chart uses x1/20, so only custom areas are affected. | Tests the longer fractions first. |
| f | `armorblockingdict`, rows `Poison` and `Disease` | Both are `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and a zero means "no damage" -- even with no armour at all. | Poison or disease applied as body damage does nothing unless "bypass armour" is ticked. | Same as his, deliberately, and flagged. It is probably meant to be applied with bypass. |

## 7. Where the rulebook and his code disagree

**Status:** open · **Severity:** clarification. His code is followed in each case.

| Rule | Player's Guide says | His code does |
|---|---|---|
| Natural 20 | "an unmodified roll of 20 is always a hit" | No such check: a natural 20 with a big enough penalty can miss. |
| Grandmaster | The attack skill table stops at Master | Adds Grandmaster, but only on the Weapon Lore chart, for mastered weapons ("cannot set Grandmaster for standard Attack Chart so just use Master"). |
| Axe Hammer speed | -- | Its speed is written `8(6)`, and his code reads any bracketed minimum speed as a *reload* time, so an Axe Hammer gets a 6-second reload. Probably meant as its thrusting speed. |

## 8. Creature attribute maximums follow a different scale from Character's

**Status:** open · **Severity:** question, may be intentional

`handleCreatureFinish` (sheet-worker.js:174723-174753) sets every attribute maximum, and every magical maximum, to 25, 28 or 30 by `creature_level` (under 10 / under 15 / otherwise). His Character path works differently: maximums start at the race's limits (`str_tmp_limit` etc., line 8099) and `setArchMortalAttributesMax` lifts them all to 27 at title 11 (line 27549). The two may simply be separate scales, since a creature's level is not a character's title, but nothing in the code says so and the numbers do not line up (28 has no Character equivalent). Worth asking whether creature levels 10 and 15 are meant to correspond to any title.

## 9. Five insect body charts write a torso multiplier without its "x"

**Status:** ANSWERED 2026-09-16, confirmed a typo · **Severity:** data typo, understates Endurance

**His answer:** *"Item 9 is a typo/bug fix, it should be x2."* The five thorax sections are meant
to be x2 like every other torso. The port now reads them as x2.

Every body area in every other chart writes its multiplier as `x1`, `x2`, `x1/2` and so on. Five charts in `getBodyList` (sheet-worker.js:175002 onward) instead write `Vital:2` for their thorax sections: `Prothorax`, `Mesathorax` and `Metathorax` in **Giant Insect** and **Giant Insect(Wings)**, and `Thorax` in **Insectoid**, **Insectoid(Wings)** and **Insectoid(Wings/Stinger)**.

`createBodyAreas` (line 180208) looks for `"x2"`, `"x3"` and so on, so `Vital:2` matches nothing and `tempMulti` is never assigned for that area. Because `tempMulti` is an implicit global, it keeps the multiplier of the *previous* area. In all nine cases that area is `x1`, so each thorax section currently gets x1 Endurance.

The evident intent is x2: the thorax is the insect's torso, and torso sections are x2 in every other chart (`Upper Torso(Vital:x2)`, `Abdomen(Vital:x2)`). The Foundry port reads the same data and also produces x1, so the two agree today. Not patched, because correcting it changes his game data (same reasoning as item 1). If he confirms x2, it is a five-line fix in his data and the port's tables regenerate from it.

## 10. Creature abilities never get the mechanical treatment racial abilities do, and the two lists disagree

**Status:** ANSWERED 2026-09-18 — the conflict list is ruled on, the Enhanced-X +10 question is still open · **Severity:** nothing left to reconcile

**His ruling on the conflict list (2026-09-18):** *"Creature is always right. This is because though
they share similar names, when applied to creatures they are slightly different. The racial ability
list and creature ability lists are not 100% identical."* On the five value rows: *"The creature
values are right. I don't know what Racial value 30 or 50 means. Enhanced Taste doesn't do a whole
heck of a lot on a creature, thus the no value."*

So the 9 canonical-name rows and 5 value rows in `docs/reference/trait-conflicts.md` all resolve to
the creature copy, which is what the pipeline already builds — **no code or data change follows**.
The two lists are deliberately not identical, not drifted: the same name means a slightly different
thing on a creature. The racial `Enhanced Taste` 30/50 is unexplained even to him, so it is not
carried anywhere.

**Earlier answer, 2026-09-16, kept below:**

**His answer:** *"Enhanced X is listed as an ability but it is flavor. It is why a creature 'might'
have a higher stat than its counterpart, or have better hearing. The creature listings are right.
The abilities is used to say how they were arrived at."*

Two things settled by that:

1. **Creatures skipping the racial switch is intended.** A creature's abilities explain its stat
   block rather than modifying it — the numbers on the listing are already what they should be,
   and the ability text says how the creature came to have them. So the creature path is not
   missing a mechanical treatment; it never wanted one.
2. **Where the two copies disagree, the creature row is the right one** — which is what the port
   already keeps.

**One thing this raises, and it needs his eye:** his own `calcAllCreatureCaracs` (sheet-worker.js:
178346) *does* add +10 Perception, Affinity or Fortune for the matching "Enhanced ..." ability, and
+5 Perception per sense ability. If the stat block already includes the enhancement — which is what
"the creature listings are right" reads as — then those additions are counting it a second time.
The port copies his additions today. **Asked back: should those +10s stay, or is the listing
already inclusive?**

**And he asked for the list:** *"I'd have to see the 41 conflicts to be able to tell exactly what
it means... So if it can provide a list, I will check on those when I see it."* Generated to
`docs/reference/trait-conflicts.md` by `tools/extract/report_trait_conflicts.py` — 39 ability rows
and 2 disability rows that differ, 40 racial-only rows, with the canonical-name differences called
out first because those are the ones that can miss a `case`.

There are two copies of each dictionary: a Character-side one used for racial abilities (`getRacialAbilityDetails`, `getRacialDisabilityDetails`, `getRacialImmunityDetails`, sheet-worker.js:45721, 45899, 45984) and a larger creature-side one (`getCreatureAbilityDetails`, `getCreatureDisabilityDetails`, `getCreatureImmunityDetails`, lines 176209, 177693, 177961). Columns are canonical name `[0]`, two values `[1]`/`[2]` whose meaning varies by entry, and description `[3]`.

**The Character path uses them mechanically.** `setTempRacialAbilities` (line 46293) walks a race's abilities, switches on each canonical name `[0]`, sets a `tmp_abilities_*` flag per ability, and reads `[1]`/`[2]` where they carry a number: hide armour value, hide Endurance-per and limit, infravision distance and others. Disabilities and immunities work the same way (lines 46823, 47038). The `immunities_*` flags that the resistance code checks are set from these.

**The creature path does not.** `createFullCreatureAbilities`, `...Disabilities` and `...Immunities` (lines 175436-175495) only concatenate `[3]` into a display string. None of the `tmp_abilities_*` or `immunities_*` flags are ever set for a creature. So a creature with "Infravision 60`" gets no infravision distance, and a creature listing "Poison" immunity is not treated as immune unless "Immune" is also typed into its poison resistance. Its only automatic ability effects are a few substring checks in `calcAllCreatureCaracs` (line 178346): +10 Perception, Affinity or Fortune for the matching "Enhanced ..." ability, and +5 Perception per sense ability and for the skills Smell, Listen and Life Sense.

**The two lists have drifted apart.** The immunity lists are identical. 40 racial abilities (such as Animal Shape, Gift of Magic and the "Natural Weapons(...)" entries) are missing from the creature list. Of the names both lists share, 39 abilities and 2 disabilities have different rows, mostly different descriptions. The differences that matter mechanically:

| Ability | Racial list | Creature list |
|---|---|---|
| Infravision30 ... Infravision180 | canonical name `Infravision` | canonical name `Infravision 30\`` etc. |
| Enhanced Taste | 30, 50 | blank, blank |
| Swimming | blank | 50 |
| Webbed Feet/Hands | blank | 30 |
| Terrain Blending | blank | 20 |
| Not Easily Surprised | blank | -15 |
| Quiet Flier / Raking Claws / Raking Talons/Claws / Metal Mechanical Form | as written | renamed `Quiet Flyer`, `Claws(Raking)`, `Talons/Claws(Raking)`, `Metal-Mechanical Form` |

The canonical-name differences matter because the racial switch keys on `[0]`. A name taken from the creature list would not match its `case`.

**Questions:** Is it intended that creatures skip the racial switch? And where the lists disagree, which one is correct? The port wants one ability compendium, so it needs to know which row to keep.

**What the port does meanwhile:** it builds the union of both copies and keeps the creature row wherever they differ, reporting all 41 conflicts and 40 racial-only entries on every content build. If the racial copy is the correct one for any of those names, say which and the build flips them — see `DECISIONS.md`, "Trait content: three packs, and the creature row wins".

**Checked and not raised:** `immunitylist["Cold"]` has canonical name "Frost". That is a deliberate alias: `"Frost"` has its own identical row (lines 177972 and 178022, and again in the racial list), which is what the canonical-name column is for. The creature ability list also repeats five keys (Breath Attack(Fire), Electric(Plant), Enhanced Hide(Bone), Fins/Flippers/Fluke, Hide Scales) and the racial list repeats one (Hide(Feathers/Fur)). The repeated rows are identical, apart from one "Plant"/"plant", so the later copy winning changes nothing.

## 11. Four attack paths lose or double-count to-hit modifiers

**Status:** open · **Severity:** real bug; removes STR/AGL to-hit modifiers in normal play

The brawling, natural-weapon, evoke and creature attack paths (sheet-worker.js:69707, 70030, 70343, 179758) add up their to-hit modifiers like this:
```js
toHitMod=toHitMod+parseInt(values.combat_mod_melee_str)||0;
toHitMod=toHitMod+parseInt(values.combat_mod_melee_other)||0;
```
Because `||` binds more loosely than `+`, each line means `toHitMod = (toHitMod + parseInt(x)) || 0`. If any field fails to parse, the whole running total resets to 0, not just that one term. `setCombatModifierValues` (lines 82347 and 82358) sets `combat_mod_melee_other` and `combat_mod_missile_other` to `"-"` whenever there are no other modifiers, which is the normal case. So:
- **Melee:** the Strength to-hit modifier added on the line before is wiped.
- **Missile** (creature attacks of type Missile, Glob or Bolt, and Projectile natural attacks): these add `combat_mod_missile`, which is already Agility plus the other modifiers (line 82356), and then `combat_mod_missile_other` as well. With no other modifiers, the `"-"` wipes the Agility modifier. With other modifiers, they are counted twice.

The main weapon attack, `handlePhysicalAttacks`, reads each value into its own variable (lines 64367-64370) and sums them. That is the evident intent, and what the Foundry port does. It is unaffected, and so is the combat already ported. The four affected paths are not ported yet; when they are, they will follow `handlePhysicalAttacks`.

## 12. `rebuildRepeatingBodyRows` never fetches `creature_type`

**Status:** open · **Severity:** minor

`rebuildRepeatingBodyRows` (sheet-worker.js:178211) checks `values.creature_type` to choose between `creature_end` and `endurance`, but `creature_type` is not in its `getAttrs` list, so its creature branch can never run and it always uses `endurance`. This is mostly harmless: `handleCreatureFinish` also writes the creature's Endurance into `endurance` (line 174948). It only matters when a temporary Endurance modifier is on a creature. `calcAllCreatureCaracs` adds that to `creature_end` but not to `endurance`, so body rows rebuilt this way ignore it. (The function also wraps its real `getAttrs` in three nested `getAttrs(['title'])` calls that use nothing. That is harmless and not ported.)

## 13. `divideWithMinAndMax` never applies its maximum

**Status:** ANSWERED 2026-09-16, confirmed a bug · **Severity:** real bug; area attacks have no upper limit

**His answer:** *"Divide with min and max means that whatever is sent into the function as min
cannot have a result below min, and whatever is sent as max cannot go over max."* That is what the
port already does; his `=>` typo means his sheet does not.

```js
function divideWithMinAndMax(tmpDividend, tmpDivisor, tmpMaxValue) {
    tempValue=parseInt(tmpDividend/tmpDivisor);
    if (tempValue<1) { tempValue=1; }
    if (tempValue>tmpMaxValue) { tempValue=>tmpMaxValue; }   // <- "=>" not "="
    return tempValue;
}
```
(sheet-worker.js:25601.) `tempValue=>tmpMaxValue` is an arrow function, not an assignment: it builds a function, throws it away, and leaves `tempValue` untouched. So the ceiling is silently ignored and only the floor of 1 works.

Seven call sites depend on it. Six are the creature area attacks (sheet-worker.js:179808-179827), where it sets how far a Bolt travels and how far a Cone reaches: a Weak Bolt is meant to stop at 100 feet, a Bolt at 150 and a Strong Bolt at 200, and a creature with high Endurance currently exceeds all of them without limit. The seventh is an invocation value (line 156907) capped at 10.

The port applies the ceiling, which is plainly what the argument is for, and the difference is recorded here. The Cloud and Glob shapes are unaffected: they cap through `setIntHighBounds`, which is written correctly.

## 14. A martial-arts damage multiplier is assigned to the wrong variable

**Status:** open · **Severity:** real bug; the multiplier is dropped

In the creature attack's multiplier handling (sheet-worker.js:180004-180010):
```js
if (MAModMulti>1.0) {
    if (damMulti>1.0) {
        damMulti=damMulti+MAModMulti;
    } else {
        damMult=MAModMulti;          // <- damMult, not damMulti
    }
}
```
`damMult` is a different name, so in the common case -- a martial-arts multiplier with no other multiplier already in play -- the multiplier is written to a variable nothing reads and the damage is never multiplied. The situational branch just above it is spelled correctly. Martial arts is phase 2 and not ported yet; noted so it is not reproduced.

## 15. A creature's called shot does not halve its damage

**Status:** open · **Severity:** rules inconsistency between the two sheets

His character path halves a called shot's damage, and the Player's Guide says a called shot does half damage whether or not it lands. His creature path (sheet-worker.js:179907-179993) never applies that: `damMulti` is only ever set from critical-fumble text or a situational multiplier, so a creature's called shot does full damage.

The port halves it for both actor types, so the same rule does not change meaning depending on who is swinging. Flagged because it is a deliberate departure from his creature code, unlike the rest of the creature port.

**Also noticed, not worth its own entry:** the hand-to-hand test at sheet-worker.js:180022 reads `if (creatureAttackType.includes("Melee") || creatureAttackType.includes("Touch") && tmpLargeAttackDetails=="")`. Because `&&` binds tighter than `||`, the "no area shape" condition only applies to Touch, not to Melee. It gates the extra magical damage and special magic text, neither of which is ported yet.

## 16. The arch-mortal attribute maximum: the comment says 25, the code sets 27

**Status:** ANSWERED 2026-09-16 — **both numbers are right** · **Severity:** the port was missing a rule

**His answer:** *"25 for normal statistic upgrades, 27 for magical upgrades. So you can raise it to
25 with stat up rolls, and 27 is the cap when using magical boosts."*

Neither number is wrong: they are **two different caps**. 25 is the ceiling for advancement by the
character's own rolls; 27 is the ceiling a magical boost may reach. His comment and his code were
each describing one of the two.

**What this means for the port:** it currently applies a single cap of 27 and so allows natural
advancement past 25. A second cap is needed — a natural maximum alongside the magical one — which
also explains the separate "magical maximum" his creature path sets and that this port had noted
without understanding.

At the title-up commit, `setArchMortalAttributesMax(newTitle)` is called with this comment:

> `// at 11th and higher racial maximums are discarded and 25 is the new max.` (sheet-worker.js:66140)

but the function itself (line 27549) sets all twelve maximums to **27**, not 25. One of the two is wrong and only he can say which. The port follows the code and uses 27.

**Worth confirming at the same time:** his sheet has no other title-driven maximum at all. Nothing caps an attribute by title below 11, and nothing raises the maximum at title 16 — there is no deity equivalent of `setArchMortalAttributesMax`. Every assignment to a `*_max` attribute was checked. The Master's Manual describes mundane, mortal, arch-mortal and deity ranges of 23 / 25 / 27 / 30, and the Foundry port originally implemented those tiers from the book; it has since been corrected to follow the sheet instead (see `DECISIONS.md`). If the book's tiers are meant to apply in play, his sheet is not applying them.

## 17. The Snake armour map is one position out of step with the Snake(Arms) chart

**Status:** open · **Severity:** real bug; armour lands on the wrong part of the snake

`getArmorValuesByBodyTypeAndArmor` (sheet-worker.js:105929) picks an armour slot from the area's **position** in the body chart, and its Snake branch is written for a chart running Head, Upper Length, Lower Length, then shoulders, arms and hands. Neither Snake chart is shaped that way:

| Position | His Snake branch expects | `Snake` chart | `Snake(Arms)` chart |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Head | Head | Head |
| 1 | Upper Length | Upper Length | Upper Length |
| 2 | Lower Length | Lower Length | **Left Shoulder** |
| 3 | Left Shoulder | Tail | **Right Shoulder** |
| 4 | Right Shoulder | — | **Left Arm** |

For the plain `Snake` the branch is harmless: only the first three positions exist, and they line up. For `Snake(Arms)` everything from position 2 on is displaced by one, so a Left Shoulder takes the Lower Torso armour value, a Right Shoulder takes the Left Shoulder's, and so on down the arms. `Snake(Arms)` also puts Lower Length at position 10, where his branch has a hand.

The port keys this mapping by area name instead of by position, so it does what the comments in his branch say rather than reproducing the shift, and every disagreement is reported when the tables are regenerated.

**Found again in a second function.** `equipShield` (line 103777) writes a shield into
`bodyAreaShieldLayer5[N]` by the same positions, and its Snake branch is written for the same
chart that does not exist: its own comments put the right forearm at 8 and the right hand at 10,
which is where they sit on the chart above, not on `Snake(Arms)`. So the shift is reproduced
there too. The port keys the shield table by area name for the same reason.

## 18. The Centaur armour map has a Mid Torso the Centaur chart does not

**Status:** open · **Severity:** real bug; armour lands on the wrong part of the centaur

Same function, same cause. His Centaur branch maps position 9 to "Mid Torso", but the Centaur chart has no Mid Torso — it runs Upper Torso, then the arms and hands, then Underbelly. So from position 9 the mapping is displaced:

| Position | His Centaur branch expects | `Centaur` chart | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | Mid Torso | Left Hand | a hand takes the Mid Torso value |
| 10 | Left Hand | Right Hand | the other hand takes the Left Hand value |
| 11 | Right Hand | Underbelly | the underbelly takes a hand's value |
| 12 | Underbelly | Forequarters | the forequarters get nothing |
| 13 | Forequarters | Left Foreleg | the barding lands one position early |

The barding rule itself is fine and worth keeping: the quarters, forelegs and hindlegs take armour only from an item whose name contains "Centaur Barding", and nothing otherwise. It is only the positions that have slipped.

**Found again in a second function.** `equipShield` (line 103777) has the same Centaur gap: its
Buckler branch puts the right hand at position 11, which is a Humanoid's Right Hand but a
Centaur's Underbelly, and its Body branch reaches positions 15 and 17 for the foreleg and fore
shin, which on the real chart are the fore shin and the hindquarters. The port keys the shield
table by area name for the same reason.

## 19. Seventeen lore title gates are written `=>` instead of `>=`, so they never gate anything

**Status:** ANSWERED 2026-09-16 · **Severity:** downgraded — not the live bug this item claimed

**His answer:** *"There is an actual chart for when they actually can use the special Lores.
Missile Lore, Weapon Lore, Second Weapon Lore. It is in a function already. Yes they gain the
skill at first but they cannot use the skill because it says 'Cannot be used non-acquired'. All of
the ones that say cannot be used non-acquired cannot be used until they actually reach the title
they are acquired at."*

So the gates below are not what stops an early character using a lore — **the "cannot be used
non-acquired" rule on the skill is**, tested against the title the skill is acquired at, and the
chart of those titles is the `get*When` family this port already generates from. Acquiring the
skill early is expected; using it early is what is blocked, elsewhere.

**What this means for the port:** the behaviour is already right — `hasLore(title, when)` gates on
exactly the title his chart gives. What is missing is the *general* rule: a skill marked "cannot be
used non-acquired" should be unusable until its acquisition title, and the port has no such flag
yet (it is the second flag the skills pass needs out of the books, beside `isRestricted` — see
`docs/sonnet/2026-09-16-skills-module.md` item 1).

**Still worth his fixing in the sheet**, since `=>` builds a throwaway arrow function and the gate
below it does nothing, even if the practical effect is covered by the non-acquired rule.

---

**Original finding, kept for the record:**

Item 13 records one place where an assignment was typed as an arrow function. It is not the only one. Searching the whole sheet for `=>` used where a comparison was meant finds **eighteen** occurrences: line 25604 (already filed as item 13) and seventeen title gates of this shape:

```js
if (currentTitle=>whenWeaponLoreAcquired) { // acquired.
```

`currentTitle=>whenWeaponLoreAcquired` is not a comparison. It builds an arrow function and discards it, and a function object is always truthy, so the branch is taken **whatever the character's title**. Every one of these gates is therefore inert, and the lore in question reads as acquired at title 1.

| Lines | Gate |
|---|---|
| 49870, 83017, 90504 | Weapon Lore acquired |
| 49915, 49925, 83025, 90524 | Missile Lore acquired |
| 49970, 49980, 83188 | Second Weapon Knowledge acquired |
| 50025, 50035, 83242 | Second Weapon Lore acquired |
| 50117, 50127 | Projectile Lore acquired |
| 50199, 50209 | Multiple Missile Lore acquired |

**What it changes in play.** These are not display-only. The gate at 82275 that *is* written correctly (`(currentTitle+1)>whenWeaponLoreAcquired`) grants +2 melee, +4 damage and +10% to skills once Weapon Lore is acquired; the broken gates control the same acquisition elsewhere, including the weapon speed adjustment in `getWeaponSpeedListingAdjustmentForModifier` (line 90484). So a title 1 character reads as having lore they should not have, in whichever of the two code paths runs.

**Worth checking together with this:** the two spellings of the correct test are not equivalent either. Line 82275 uses `(currentTitle+1)>whenAcquired` while line 83017 means `currentTitle>=whenAcquired`; those agree, but only by accident of the `+1`. Whichever he intends should probably be written the same way in both.

The port does not reproduce any of this: the Lore *attack chart* is keyed off `getLoreAttackChart`, whose own `tempTitle>=N` comparisons are written correctly. The six lore-acquisition tables (`getWeaponLoreWhen`, `getMissileLoreWhen`, `getProjectileLoreWhen`, `getMultiMissileLoreWhen`, `getSpellLoreWhen`, `getArmorLoreWhen`, lines 94997-95884) are a separate piece of work and are not ported yet.

**Also worth a look while you are in there:** `Humanoid(Fish Tail)` has 14 areas ending in a Finned Tail at position 13, which is where the Humanoid branch maps a Left Thigh — so a merfolk tail is armoured as though it were a thigh. And the Insectoid charts name positions "Left Mid Claw/Hand" and "Left Lower Leg" where the branch's comments say "Left Mid Claw" and "Left Shin"; those two are only wording, and the mapping is right.

**All six do have a correctly written gate — they are not blocked.** Every one of the six is
gated correctly inside `setGeneralCombatModifierDisplay` (line 82451), in the form
`if ((currentTitle+1)>whenAcquired)`, which for whole titles is exactly `title >= when`:

| Lore | Correct gate | Broken gates elsewhere |
|---|---|---|
| Weapon Lore | 82558 | 49870, 83017, 90504 |
| Missile Lore | 82589 | 49915, 49925, 83025, 90524 |
| Second Weapon Knowledge | 82620 | 49970, 49980, 83188 |
| Second Weapon Lore | 82657 | 50025, 50035, 83242 |
| Projectile Lore | 82715 | 50117, 50127 |
| Multiple Missile Lore | 82763 | 50199, 50209 |

Not one of the seventeen broken gates is inside that function; they are all in other paths. So the
intended rule is stated unambiguously in your own code for all six, and none of them needs a
decision from you before it can be ported — only the broken gates need fixing. `setCombatModifierValues`
(82167) gates Weapon and Missile Lore correctly too, so the numeric path for those two is sound.

## 20. "Enduring All" endures nine damage types out of ten

**Status:** ANSWERED 2026-09-16, intentional — **nothing to fix** · **Severity:** none

**His answer:** *"Endure All existed as a spell before Obliteration existed as an energy type. It
is a level 22 spell, so it doesn't include Obliteration. You need the special Endure Obliteration
to be protected from it."*

Deliberate, and for a reason the code could not have shown: the spell predates the damage type.
The port's generated `ENDURED_BY` already matches this exactly, so nothing changes.

`getIsEndured` (sheet-worker.js:120871) switches on the damage type, and each case looks for its
own tag on anything worn and then for a blanket `Enduring All`:

```js
case "Frost":
    if (tempEquippedArmorAndClothing.includes("Enduring Frost")) { wasEndured=true; }
    if (tempEquippedArmorAndClothing.includes("Enduring All")) { wasEndured=true; }
    break;
```

Nine of the ten cases are written exactly that way — Light, Sonic, Frost, Kinetic, Flame,
Electricity, Acid, Aura/Divine and Life/Death. The tenth is not:

```js
case "Obliteration":
    if (tempEquippedArmorAndClothing.includes("Enduring Obliteration")) { wasEndured=true; }
    break;
```

So a character wearing `Enduring All` still takes Obliteration damage in full, and needs
`Enduring Obliteration` specifically.

That may be exactly right — Obliteration reads like the damage type nothing is meant to shrug
off, and making the blanket tag stop short of it is a reasonable design. But it is also precisely
what a dropped line looks like, and the name "Enduring All" says otherwise. Worth one word either
way.

**What matters about it in play:** an endured blow does not simply take less damage. His handler
branches past the entire apply block for it (`else if (!reboundOn && !enduredOn)`, line 71249),
so an endured blow does **nothing** — no damage, no armour wear, no effect triggered. So this is
the difference between total immunity and none at all, not a matter of degree.

**What the port does:** follows the switch exactly. `ENDURED_BY` in `module/combat-tables.mjs` is
generated from it, so if the line is added upstream the table picks it up on the next run.

**Also worth a glance while you are there:** the `else` that catches a rebounded or endured blow
(line 71439) carries the comment `// Area is already lost (nothing more can be done to it)`. The
lost-area case is handled separately and earlier, at line 71322, so that comment is stale rather
than wrong-in-effect — the branch is reached by rebound and endure. Only the comment misleads.

## 21. The per-weapon lore bonus reaches the attack, but Missile Lore's damage is dropped

**Status:** open · **Severity:** real bug; a specifically lored missile weapon does no extra damage

*(Rewritten 2026-09-12. An earlier version of this item said the per-weapon tier was never applied
at all. That was read from the stored-modifier path alone and was wrong — the attack path does
apply it. The real defect is narrower and is below.)*

Weapon Lore and Missile Lore each grant two tiers: a general one for every weapon of the kind and
a larger one for a weapon named in the lore list. `handlePhysicalAttacks` applies the specific
tier properly, by taking the general modifier back off and putting the specific one on
(sheet-worker.js:64764-64781):

```js
modMeleeOther=modMeleeOther-2;   // remove the general +2
modWL=3;                          // apply the specific +3
modDamOther=modDamOther-4;        // remove the general +4
WLDamMod=6;                       // apply the specific +6
```

`modWL` reaches the melee to-hit total (64806) and `modML` the missile one (64804). `WLDamMod`
reaches the rolled damage (65092). **`MLDamMod` does not.** It is set to 6 at 64777, it is tested
at 65017, it is added to `totalDamMod` for the printed listing at 65063 — and it is missing from
the sum that actually rolls:

```js
damageRolled=damageRolled+modDamStrength+modDamWeight+modDamOther+DamMod2Hand+offHandDamMod
            +modSoldieringDamage+WLDamMod+sitModDamage+modProjLoreDamMod
            +multiMissileKnowMissileDamMod+MAModDamage+tempMartialStanceModDamage;
```

`WLDamMod` is there; `MLDamMod` is not. So a character with Missile Lore in a specific bow is
told in the damage listing that they get +6, and does not get it. Melee is unaffected.

**Separately, the weapon speed is still a tangle.** `getWeaponSpeedListingAdjustmentForModifier`
(90484) gives a lored weapon a further -1 with the comment "only give a -1 more, -1 is already
accounted for in the general mod". That comment is stale: the general -1 is not in the general
modifier. It was deliberately removed, and the reason is at line 82273 — "Removed because you
can`t add a general mod for speed for weapon lore if the weapon might only be a missile weapon" —
which `combat_mod_weaponspeed` (82394) confirms, summing only Strength, Agility, armour, divine
mobility and the temporary modifier. So the panel promises -1 general and -2 specific, and the
sheet delivers 0 and -1.

**What the port does:** applies both tiers to to-hit, damage and speed, for melee and missile
alike, with the specific figure replacing the general one exactly as your attack code does. That
means it gives the missile damage your listing promises, and gives -1/-2 on speed. The
melee-versus-missile problem that forced the speed removal does not arise here, because the port
works lore out per weapon and per attack mode rather than as one figure for the whole character.

**Worth deciding at the same time:** whether the -1 general weapon speed should apply to melee
weapons only, which is what your removal comment implies you wanted and could not express with a
single character-wide modifier.


## 22. Five classes have no `classRequirementsAndDetails` row at all

**Status:** ANSWERED 2026-09-16 — **this finding was wrong** · **Severity:** the port was looking in one dictionary

**His answer:** *"Items 22/26 is incorrect, the data is there. I can see it on the sheet when I try
to make a Roll20 character of those types (minus Elemental Dancer)."* Plus, on what those five
classes actually are:

- **GME** — *"a special case in the class type. It isn't a real class. It allows you to select ANY
  social skills, and any racial skills, 1 at a time to fill the slots, and they are 0-title
  non-classed characters."* And separately: *"GMEs do not get the racial title 1 starting bonuses
  like extra endurance, etc."*
- **Elementalist, Summoner, Inquisitor** — *"have special choices (good vs. evil), etc. that make
  it so that choice means a different varied skill. If it wants to resolve those it could either
  add the choice that splits it down the path, or make a separate entry for Inquisitor Fanatical
  Good vs Inquisitor Fanatical Evil, etc."*

**What this means for the port:** the five are not missing data, they are data the port has not
found yet because it only looked in `classRequirementsAndDetails`. Two jobs follow: find where
these rows actually live, and decide between a choice field and one document per path for the three
alignment-split classes (he is happy with either). GME wants its own treatment as a non-class: no
class title, no racial title-1 bonuses, and skill slots filled from any list.

`classtitledict` and `goalupdict` each hold **92** classes. `classRequirementsAndDetails` holds
**88**. Five names appear in the first two and in no row of the third:

| Class | In `classtitledict` | In `goalupdict` | In `classRequirementsAndDetails` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elemental Dancer | yes | yes | **no** |
| Elementalist | yes | yes | **no** |
| GME | yes | yes | **no** |
| Inquisitor | yes | yes | **no** |
| Summoner | yes | yes | **no** |

So your sheet knows those classes' title names and goal attributes, and knows nothing about their
requirements, class modifiers, armour or weapon usage, attack progression or description. Four of
the five are also in `getLoreAttackChart`, so the sheet will happily work out a Lore attack chart
for a class it cannot otherwise describe.

("GME" may not be a playable class at all — worth confirming rather than assuming.)

**Separately, Monk is a sixth case with a different cause.** It *is* in
`classRequirementsAndDetails`, but with 21 columns instead of 22, so this port rejects the row
rather than guessing where the missing column belongs — that is item 1, still open.

**What the port does:** `Elemental Dancer` is authored by hand in `src/packs/manual/classes.json`
from your own Word template ("2c, Elemental Dancer.doc"), and merged in by `build_documents.py`
after the generated classes. A manual entry never overwrites a class your data can build, so if
you add the missing rows the generated one wins automatically and the manual entry is reported as
redundant. The other four have no template to hand and remain unbuilt.

## 23. ~~Fourteen races cannot move~~ — WITHDRAWN, this was our misreading

**Status:** withdrawn · **Severity:** none · **Nothing here needs your attention**

This item claimed that fourteen races — all four Civilized Humans among them — had no movement
figures in `raceStatsAndMoveDetails`, and asked you to fill them in. **That was wrong, and the
request is withdrawn.** Your data was right the whole way through.

The columns at indices 39-47 are **modifiers on an Agility base, not finished rates**. Your own
`calcMovement` (`sheet-worker.js:30856`) switches on Agility for a base and adds the race's figure
to it:

```js
setAttrs({move_walk_hourly: 2+racetmpwalkhourly+tmpwalktemphourlymod});
//                          ^ base for this Agility
//                            ^ the race's modifier
```

So a race carrying `0, 0, 0` is a race with **no modifier**, which walks at the full base for its
Agility. Civilized Humans being the baseline race with no adjustment anywhere — attributes included
— is exactly as deliberate as it looked. The Player's Guide prints the same split on page 36: "Base
Walking/Jogging/Running Distance" tables by Agility, then a separate "Racial Movement Modifiers"
table beside them. Your Human(Barbaric) row is that book table's `+1/+10/+1`, `+2/+20/+2`,
`+2/+30/+3` to the digit, and all 42 printed base values match your switch exactly.

Marid, Merfolk and Se'eth are not stationary either. Their Walk is a zero *modifier*, so it resolves
normally, and their Swim and Slither rates build on the resolved figure.

**What went wrong on our side:** the port copied the race's modifier straight through as the
finished rate and never applied the Agility base, so every race with a `0` modifier rendered as
unable to move. Fixed — the base table is now generated out of your `calcMovement` rather than
transcribed, and is cross-checked against the two copies of it in your own code, which agree.

The lesson is recorded in `DECISIONS.md`; the apology for asking you to fix data that was never
broken is recorded here.

## 25. Magical flight multiplies twice, making the ten-second rate a hundred times the one-second rate

**Status:** open · **Severity:** two races (Mephyt(Fire), Mephyt(Ice)); the port departs from your
code here, so this one needs your ruling

`calcSpecialMovement`'s INT branch — magical flight — applies a literal 30 / 30 / 3 **on top of** the
race's own per-scale multiplier (`sheet-worker.js:32397`):

```js
setAttrs({move_special_hourly: [[((0+tmpint)*hourracemulti)+tmpspecialtemphourlymod]*30] });
setAttrs({move_special_10_sec: [[((0+tmpint)*tensecracemulti)+tmpspecialtemp10secmod]*30] });
setAttrs({move_special_1_sec: [[((0+tmpint)*onesecracemulti)+tmpspecialtemp1secmod]*3] });
```

Both Mephyt rows carry per-scale multipliers of **0.75, 30, 3** where every other race in the file
uses one value for all three scales:

```
Mephyt(Fire) ... 'INT', 0.75, 0,  'INT', 30, 0,  'INT', 3, 0 ...
Centaur      ... 'Walk', 4,   0,  'Walk', 4,  0,  'Walk', 4, 0 ...
```

Those three numbers are already a complete set of rates on their own — 30 feet per 10 seconds is
exactly ten times 3 feet per second, the same relationship every other rate in the system has.
Multiplying them again gives a ten-second rate **one hundred times** the one-second rate:

| | your live code | the multipliers alone |
|---|---|---|
| hourly | INT × 22.5 | INT × 0.75 |
| 10 seconds | INT × 900 | INT × 30 |
| 1 second | INT × 9 | INT × 3 |

At Intelligence 16 the live code gives 14,400 feet per ten seconds — about 980 miles an hour — beside
an hourly rate of 360 miles. The two scales do not describe the same creature.

**The version commented out immediately above it (lines 32366-32368) is the multiplier alone**, with
no literal factor, which matches the data exactly. That looks like the intended form and the live
line like a revision that went one step too far.

**What the port does:** applies the multiplier on its own, giving 12 mi/h, 480 ft per 10 seconds and
48 ft per second at Intelligence 16. This is a **deliberate departure from your code**, which the
standing "the sheet wins" rule does not cover — that rule settles sheet-versus-rulebook, and this is
your code disagreeing with your own data and your own commented-out line. Three signals to one, but
it is still your call, and it is one line to put back either way.

---

## 24. Sea and Ice Elves have a speed multiplier of -10, which makes their movement negative

**Status:** open · **Severity:** two races; needs a decision from you, not a guess from us

`raceStatsAndMoveDetails` index 38 is the speed multiplier. Two races carry **-10** there:

| Race | index 38 | Wood Elf, for comparison |
|---|---|---|
| Elf(Sea) | **-10** | 0 |
| Elf(Ice) | **-10** | 0 |

Everywhere else in the file that column is `0`, which your own comment in `calcSpecialMovement`
confirms is the sentinel for "no multiplier": *"most races are 0 (this makes the multiplier 1"*.

`calcMovement` remaps only `0`, so `-10` reaches the multiplier branch intact and is multiplied
through with no guard:

```js
} else {  // this race has speeded up movement (apply multiplier)
    setAttrs({move_walk_hourly: (((2+racetmpwalkhourly+...)*racetmpspeedmulti).toFixed(1)) });
```

A Sea Elf of Agility 15 therefore ends up at roughly **-50 miles an hour** on your sheet rather than
the 5 a Wood Elf gets. The neighbouring columns look deliberate (index 36 is -10 for several Elves
as a poison-resistance modifier), so the most likely reading is that a value slid one column, but
that is a guess and we are not acting on it.

**There is a hole in the column immediately before it.** Of the eleven Elf races, every one carries a
disease-resistance modifier at index 37 — except these same two, which carry nothing:

| Race | 36 poison | 37 disease | 38 speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elf(Dark) | -5 | -10 | 0 |
| Elf(High) | -10 | -10 | 0 |
| Elf(Wood) | -10 | -5 | 0 |
| Elf(Shadow) | -10 | -20 | 0 |
| **Elf(Sea)** | -10 | **0** | **-10** |
| **Elf(Ice)** | -10 | **0** | **-10** |

A `-10` sitting in a column no other race uses, directly beside an empty cell that every sibling race
fills, looks like one value entered one column to the right. Nothing after index 38 is shifted — the
walk, jog and run figures match the other Elves exactly — so it would be a single cell rather than a
displaced row. **We have not acted on that reading**; correcting a disease resistance on a guess is
not ours to do.

**What the port does:** it ignores a negative speed multiplier rather than applying it, on the
narrower ground that a negative multiplier is not a coherent quantity — multiplying scales a rate, it
does not reverse its direction — and that 103 of your 105 races use `0` here to mean "none". Sea and
Ice Elves therefore move exactly like every other Elf: at Agility 15 a Sea Elf walks 6 miles an hour
and swims three times that, the same shape Merfolk has.

The first version of this fix instead applied the floor your Player's Guide publishes for negative
rates (p.36 — *"reduced to 1 mile (hourly), 10 feet (10 seconds) or 1 foot (1 second)"*). That
stopped the negative numbers but left a **sea** elf swimming at 1 mile an hour, slower than it walks,
which is its own kind of wrong. The floor is still implemented, because it is a real published rule
and is genuinely reachable — a Civilized Dwarf at Agility 5 goes under it on walking modifiers alone
— but it is no longer what these two races land on.

Three things worth your confirmation: whether `-10` at index 38 is intended at all; whether it was
meant for index 37, where these two Elves are the only ones with no disease modifier; and whether you
want the book's negative floor implemented in the Roll20 sheet, which currently has no guard at all.

**Two disagreements between that template and your sheet-worker**, both resolved in the
sheet-worker's favour per the standing rule, both worth your confirmation:

| | `sheet-worker.js` | the Word template |
|---|---|---|
| Goal attributes | `goalupdict`: **STR, AGL** | "+1 Strength 5%, +1 **Will Force** 5%" |
| Title 15 name | `classtitledict`: "One with the Element" | "One with `<Element>`" (a placeholder) |

The goal-attribute one is the one that matters: Agility and Will Force are not interchangeable,
and a Dancer's own requirements list Strength, Agility **and** Will Force at 15, so either reading
is plausible.

**A cross-check that held:** the template lists Weapon Lore as a title 8 class skill, and
`getWeaponLoreWhen` independently returns 8 for this class. The two sources agree there.

**Also noticed:** `Beguiler`'s `classType` contains a paragraph of description rather than a class
type ("This class has the focus of illusions and uses these skills to dazzle and confuse their
foes..."). That has the look of the same kind of column slip as item 1, in a different row.

---

## 26. Five classes have no entry in `getSlotsNeededForClass`, so they read as costing no class skill slots

**Status:** ANSWERED 2026-09-16 with item 22 · **Severity:** follows item 22 — the data exists, the port had not found it

See item 22. GME legitimately needs no class slots (it is not a class); the other four are a
lookup problem on this end, not a gap in his data.

`getSlotsNeededForClass` (sheet-worker.js:62881) gives each class the number of class skill slots it
needs to run its whole progression — 92 cases, from 36 (Border Scout, Explorer) to 56 (Assassin,
Monk). This is the number the Player's Guide's "slot tricks" exist to reach: Knowledge hands out a
fixed allowance of class slots, and where it falls short the shortfall is made up by transferring
racial or social slots in.

The five classes of item 22 — Elemental Dancer, Elementalist, GME, Inquisitor, Summoner — have no
`classRequirementsAndDetails` row, and four of them have no case in this switch either. GME does, at
0, which is right: it is your stand-in for a being with no class at all, so it genuinely costs no
class slots.

**The consequence is quiet.** A class with no entry reads as 0, and 0 here does not mean "unknown",
it means "this class is free to take" — it would let a character take the class without spending any
of their Knowledge allowance. That is why the conversion reports it every run rather than letting it
default silently.

**What would settle it for Elemental Dancer**, the one of the five now authored from your Word
template: a naive count of the skills across its fifteen titles comes to **60**, which is higher
than any of your 86 classes. But its last five titles each list `Sense Supernatural` at 20%, 40%,
60%, 80% and 99% — which reads as **one skill improving across five titles rather than five separate
acquisitions**. Counting it once gives **56**, exactly your own ceiling and the same figure as
Assassin and Monk.

That is suggestive enough to be worth asking about and far too inferential to bake in, so nothing is
written. **Is 56 right for Elemental Dancer, and do the other four want entries too?** A one-line
answer per class closes this.

## 27. `Beguiler`'s description and class type are swapped

**Status:** open · **Severity:** cosmetic; a data-entry slip in one row, not a parsing defect

`classRequirementsAndDetails["Beguiler"]` is a full 22 columns — the right length, unlike Monk
(item 1) — so this is not a missing-column problem. Two adjacent cells are simply transposed. Every
other class puts its long description at index 9 and its short class type at index 10:

```
Warrior  -> idx9: "Warriors are the masters of brutal fighting..."   idx10: "Primary class"
Bard     -> idx9: "A Warrior with magical reciting, singing..."      idx10: "Warrior subclass"
Assassin -> idx9: "Assassins use stealth and deceit..."              idx10: "Rogue subclass"
```

Beguiler has the two the other way round:

```
Beguiler -> idx9: "Mage subclass"                                    idx10: "This class has the focus of illusions..."
```

**The consequence in the built document:** `description` reads "Mage subclass" and `classType`
reads the paragraph that should be the description. The class functions — nothing downstream
parses `classType` as anything but a display string — but a player opening the Beguiler class
sees no description at all, and a class-type filter or listing would show a paragraph where it
expects "Mage subclass".

**What the port does:** builds the row as given, since guessing which of two plausible values goes
where a class is concerned is exactly the kind of correction the project does not make unilaterally
(same reasoning as Monk). Likely fix is swapping the two cells; worth your one-line confirmation
rather than assumed.

## 28. Double/triple missile fire: the book says roll each attack separately, your sheet rolls once

**Status:** open · **Severity:** rules disagreement, and the two give different results at the table

The Player's Guide, "Unconventional Attacks" (p.182), on firing two or three projectiles at once:

> Double/Triple Missile Fire: Daggers, stilettos, arrows, stars, and rocks/bullets (sling) can be
> fired two or three at a time. This maneuver can only be tried at point blank or short range.
> **Roll each attack separately.**

Your sheet does not roll each attack separately. `handlePhysicalAttacks` makes ONE attack roll and
then reports that the others land for the same damage again (sheet-worker.js:65168-65187):

```
// 2 Projectiles
if (sitModSpecial.includes("2 Projectiles") && tempMissileCheck=="on") {
    if (damageListing.includes("Damage")) {
        extraDamageListing=" 2nd projectile hits the same target for the same damage.";
```

**These are not the same maneuver.** Rolling separately means each arrow can hit or miss on its
own, can land in a different body area, and can fumble on its own. One roll with repeated damage
means both arrows always share the first one's fate — two hits or two misses, both in the same
location. The penalties (-4/-6 for two, -8/-12 for three) are identical either way, so the
difference is entirely in how the hits resolve.

**What the port does:** follows your sheet, per the standing rule that where the sheet and a book
disagree the sheet wins. Firing two projectiles is one roll, and a hit does its damage times the
number of projectiles, shown on the card as "23 each × 2 projectiles".

**Worth a line back either way.** If the single roll is deliberate — it is faster at the table and
it is what your code has done for years — the port is already right and this note can be closed. If
the book's version is what you play, the change is small and localised: `resolveMultiMissile`
already reports `shots`, so the attack path would loop that many attack rolls instead of
multiplying one damage figure.

## 29. Multiple Missile Knowledge's worked example contradicts its own rule

**Status:** open · **Severity:** the book disagrees with the book; your sheet follows the rule, and so does the port

Master's Manual, Multiple Missile Knowledge, General Usage — first the rule:

> For every 25% of the skill chance, the penalties are removed by -1 for hit rolls and -2 for
> damage rolls

then, three lines later, the worked example:

> Thus, at 50% skill chance the practitioner could have no penalties to hit or damage when firing
> two arrows at once.

**The two do not agree.** Firing two arrows costs -4 to hit and -6 damage (Player's Guide, p.182).
50% is two levels, and two levels by the stated rule removes 2 of the to-hit penalty and 4 of the
damage penalty:

```
  25%  ->  1 level   ->  hit -3,  damage -4
  50%  ->  2 levels  ->  hit -2,  damage -2     <- the example claims this is zero and zero
  75%  ->  3 levels  ->  hit -1,  damage  0
 100%  ->  4 levels  ->  hit  0,  damage  0
```

By the rule as written, two arrows only come entirely free at 100%. The example would come out
right if each level were worth 2 to hit and 3 damage, which is not what the rule says.

**Your sheet implements the rule, not the example** (sheet-worker.js:64672-64684): levels are
`chance/25`, the to-hit bonus is the level count and the damage bonus is twice it, each capped at
the penalty it is cancelling. The port does the same, so a 50% practitioner fires two arrows at
-2/-2 rather than clean.

**A second, smaller thing while you are here:** the 25 is the only one of its kind. Every other
buy-down skill in your sheet steps every 20% — Second Weapon Knowledge (83188), Projectile
Knowledge (82740), Second Weapon Lore's extra seconds (83242). The Master's Manual says 25 for this
one and your code agrees, so the port implements 25 and has not quietly normalised it; noted only
so you know it was seen rather than missed.

## 30. Two Player's Guide language rules your sheet does not implement

**Status:** open · **Severity:** question; nothing is broken, the port just needs to know whether to build them

The port now works out the language allowance from Intelligence exactly as your `setLangSheet`
(sheet-worker.js:49228) and `setUpdateLanguageSheet` (50561) do. The two switches agree for every
rating 0-30, and the labels match yours: "Speaks(quarter):", "Speaks/third writes:" and so on.
The Player's Guide has two further rules that change the number, and neither appears anywhere in
your code:

1. **Language Lore doubles spoken languages.** Skill description (p.117): *"Beings who have
   Language Lore as an acquired skill can learn double their normal number of spoken
   languages."* Your sheet has Language Lore in the skill list and in seven classes' progressions,
   and nothing reads it against the language slots.
2. **Racial skill slots can be sacrificed for languages** (Skill Slot Sacrificing for Languages,
   p.78): one racial slot for a third of a language, two for two-thirds, three for a whole one.
   Your four slot-conversion functions have no language route.

**What the port does now:** neither. It follows your sheet, so a Language Lore holder at
Intelligence 14 has two slots, not four. **Both are small to add if you want them:** one flag on
the allowance for the first, and a seventh counter beside the six `tmp_*_slots_removed` moves the
port already mirrors for the second. Are these rules you still use at the table, or ones that
were dropped?

**One small thing seen along the way:** your sheet has a *quarter* step at Intelligence 4
("Speaks(quarter):"). The book describes only thirds. The port uses your quarter.

## 31. Encumbrance never slows anyone down in your sheet, and two small things in `calcEncumbrance`

**Status:** open · **Severity:** one question, two minor code notes

**The question.** `calcEncumbrance` (sheet-worker.js:81745) works out the four bands, scales armour
and gear by the being's size, lightens magical items, and writes `encumbrance_status`. Nothing
reads that status except its label on the sheet, so a heavily encumbered character walks exactly
as fast as an unburdened one. The Player's Guide's Encumbrance Table (p.38) has a penalty for
each band: 3/4 speed, 1/2 speed, and 1/4 speed with no running or sprinting. Your top band's own
label, "Over weight(cannot move)", suggests movement was meant to follow the load.

**What the port does:** it shows your unencumbered rates as they are. When the load costs
something, it also shows a second set, "At current load: 1/2 speed", worked out with the book's
factors. It does not replace your figures. Should the loaded rates simply *be* the rates? Or is
leaving them to the player on purpose? The book's fatigue multipliers (x2/x3/x4) are not ported
either, since there is no fatigue system yet.

**Two small things seen while porting it:**
1. **An unreachable branch in the size scaling.** Under one foot tall, the code tests
   `tmp_character_weight<21`, then `<20`. Anything under 20 is already under 21, so the x.0075
   case can never run. The other bands step 20 / 40 / 80 and so on, so perhaps `<10` then `<20`
   was meant. The port leaves the unreachable case out rather than guess.
2. **`tmp_weight` is not defined inside `calcEncumbrance`.** The function reads the body weight
   into `tmp_character_weight`, but works the bands out from `tmp_weight`. That is a global set by
   a different function (line 29651). It works whenever that other function has run first. If it
   has not, the bands come out as 0 and everything reads "Over weight". The port uses the body
   weight directly.

**The port also scales by size only when a height has been entered.** Your character creation
always sets one, but a Foundry actor starts at 0, and 0 inches would otherwise read as "under a
foot" and shrink the whole load to a hundredth.

## 32. Mixed races: Half Race is ported from your code; three questions about the rest

**Status:** open · **Severity:** questions; Half Race works

The port now supports a character of two races, ported from your `applyHalfRaceToAttribs`
(sheet-worker.js:33770). Your `averageTwoFloatsRounded` turned out to be the Player's Guide's
own Half Race rule 1, word for word in code: a modifier only one race has is taken whole, two
bonuses are averaged rounding up, two penalties are averaged rounding towards the bigger one, and a
bonus against a penalty is added. Special movement comes from the first race, swimming from either,
and the two ages as your `setAge` takes them.

1. **Multi Race(3), Multi Race(4), Part Race and Trace Race** are on your `race_type` list, but
   `applyRaceToAttribs` (32966) answers each with "not yet implemented. Nothing done." The book has
   rules for all of them: Multi and Part in the Player's Guide p.33, Trace in the Master's Manual.
   Part and Trace both depend on the player *choosing* two areas to mix, so they are not a formula.
   Do you want them built from the book, or are they on your own list? Until then the port combines
   the first two races and reports any third on the sheet rather than dropping it silently.
2. **The Player's Guide gives every mixed-race character -5 Social Class** ("Mixed race
   characters are often shunned by both of the parent races"). Nothing in your half-race code
   applies it, so the port does not either. Should it?
3. ~~Which races can breed with which: your sheet does not check it.~~ **Corrected the same
   day:** it does. `racefertiledict` (32833) is the list your Half Race picker offers as the second
   race, so an infertile pair cannot be chosen at all. The port has no picker, so it reports an
   infertile pair on the sheet rather than refusing it, the same way it reports an unqualified
   dual class. No question here any more.

**A second slip, in `getBestModifierPercent`.** Its signature is
`function getBestModifierPercent(numberString1, numberString1)`: both parameters have the same
name, so the second shadows the first and both numbers are read from the second argument. When
both halves of a half race offer the same racial skill, `combineTwoRaceSkillDetails` therefore
always takes the **second** race's bonus rather than the better one, and a blank bonus comes out as
"+0%". The port keeps the better bonus, which is plainly what the name says.

**One slip seen in passing:** in `setNewCharacteristics` (27499-27505), a half race's new Endurance
at titles 11-12 adds both races' maximums and then immediately overwrites the sum with the first
race's alone, before halving. So it comes out as half the first race's maximum rather than the
average of the two. The port has no title-Endurance roll yet, so nothing is affected here.

## 33. Class paths: two small slips around the choices made when a class is taken

**Status:** open · **Severity:** minor; the port works around both

The port now builds the classes whose skills depend on a choice as one document per path, all
from your code. Every class's per-title skills come from `setClassSkillLists` (57903), and the
five classes `checkClassQualification` answers inline from its own rows (50885). That covers
Elemental Dancer's six elements, Elementalist and Summoner's Call of Life / Call of Death,
Innominate's Detect Evil / Detect Good, Inquisitor's Bless / Blasphemy, and the Knights'
Standard / Templar. Two things came up:

1. **Innominate's Detect Good path can never get its own alignment.** In `getAlignRequirements`
   (51258-51265) both branches test `goodorevilselect=="Detect Evil"`:
   ```
   if (goodorevilselect=="Detect Evil") { ...Good (Active), Fanatical Good (Active) }
   else if (goodorevilselect=="Detect Evil") { ...Evil (Active), Fanatical Evil (Active) }   <- never reached
   ```
   So choosing Detect Good still demands a Good alignment. The port reads the evident intent:
   Detect Good is the evil path, requiring Evil (Active) or Fanatical Evil (Active).
2. **The Knight variant can never be chosen.** `setClassSkillLists` gives Knight and Knight(Dark) a
   Templar variant (Shield Knowledge in place of Stun, Fearless in place of Meditate), but
   `knight_choice_sheet` is only ever set to `"knight_choice_none"` (34834, 50882), so the select is
   never shown. The port offers both variants: "Knight" and "Knight(Templar)", "Knight(Dark)" and
   "Knight(Dark Templar)". Say if the Templar is retired and should go.

**Also worth knowing:** your data now builds Elemental Dancer directly from the inline row, so the
entry hand-authored from your Word template is no longer used. Where the template and your code
differ, your code is what the port now shows.

## 34. Eight skills write their starting dice "dl0" instead of "d10"

**Status:** open · **Severity:** data typo; the port reads the evident intent

In `skilldict`, eight skills give their starting dice with a lower-case letter L where the digit 1
belongs: four "5dl0%", three "2dl0%", one "4dl0%". Your `rollDiceFromString` would not read "dl0"
as d10, so on your sheet those skills probably start with no rolled bonus at all. The new character
generator reads them as d10. The quickest fix on your side is a find-and-replace of `dl0` with `d10`
in the dictionary.

**Confirmed against the book (2026-09-19):** the Player's Guide prints d10 for all eight: Shadowing,
Sleight of Hand and Street Knowledge 2d10% (pp.139-140), Bookbinder, Candle/Oil Making, Dancing and
Sewing 5d10% (pp.149-159), Espionage 4d10% (p.152). Each entry's rating and learn time match the
book too, so these are one mistyped character each, most likely from copying out of a scanned
text, where "l" and "1" are easily confused. That was the only such slip in the skill dictionaries.

## 35. `getExpByGoal` writes `case 30:` twice, so goal 40 answers 0 experience

**Status:** open · **Severity:** a level-up table returns 0 where it should return 676,000

`getExpByGoal` (sheet-worker.js:91991) has two `case 30:` labels. The second sits exactly where
`case 40:` belongs, between 39 and 41:

```
case 39: tempExp=606000; break;
case 30: tempExp=676000; break;   // this should be case 40
case 41: tempExp=746000; break;
```

JavaScript takes the first matching label, so the second is unreachable and `getExpByGoal(40)`
falls off the end of the switch and returns 0. Goal 40 is the second goal of 14th title, so it only
bites a character in the Arch Mortal range — which may be why it has not been noticed.

Your other three experience functions agree with each other and with the fix: `getNewGoal` puts
goal 40 at 676,000, and `getNextGoalExp` names 676,000 as a threshold. The port's tables are
generated from `getNewGoal` for this reason, and the generator prints the disagreement on every
run. Changing `case 30:` to `case 40:` is the whole fix.

**Also in the same family, much smaller:** `getExpByGoal` says goal -2 begins at -1,000, while
`getNewGoal`'s branch (`newTotalExp<-999`) puts it at -999. One of the two is out by a point. The
port follows `getNewGoal`, since that is the function that actually decides a character's goal.

## 36. A half race's 11th and 12th title Endurance is worked out from one parent only

**Status:** open · **Severity:** a Half Race Arch Mortal gains less Endurance than intended

`setNewCharacteristics` (sheet-worker.js:27479) rolls the Endurance a title brings. For a Half Race
it takes both parents' formulas, adds them and halves the total — in every branch except the one
for titles 11 and 12:

```
tempNewEND=getMaxValueFromDiceString(tempENDFormula1);
tempNewEND=tempNewEND+getMaxValueFromDiceString(tempENDFormula2);
tempNewEND=getMaxValueFromDiceString(tempENDFormula1);   // the sum is thrown away here
tempNewEND=divideWithMinRoundUp(tempNewEND, 2);
```

The third line overwrites the sum with the first parent's figure alone, so the result is half of one
parent rather than half of both. The 13th, 14th and 15th title branches directly below it do the
same three steps without that line, which is what makes it look like a stray paste rather than a
rule. A Human|Elf at 11th gains 3 where 13th gives 5.

The port reproduces it, since your sheet is the source of truth, and says so in the code and in a
test. Confirm it is a slip and it will be corrected in both places.

## 37. Four races get no height at all: they are missing from `getRaceHeightType`

**Status:** open · **Severity:** those four characters have no height, and so no weight either

`getRaceHeightType` (sheet-worker.js:35583) answers a race with its height band. Four races a
character can actually be have no case in it:

```
Giant(Civilized)          but Giant(Civilized:Seafaring) is there, as "Giant"
Human(Civilized:City)     but Human(Civilized:Village) is there, as "Average"
Human(Civilized:Port)
Human(Civilized:Town)
```

The switch falls through to `""`, so `setTempRaceHeight`'s own switch matches nothing and the
height array stays all zeroes. And because weight is read off the height — `getTempFrame` picks the
table, the height picks the band within it — those four get no weight either, which then means no
carrying capacity, encumbrance being a fraction of body weight.

The port fills them from their siblings, which is unambiguous in each case (a Civilized Giant beside
a Seafaring one; the three Humans beside the Village one), reports the substitution on every
extraction run, and carries the evidence in `tools/extract/extract_physique_tables.py`. Four `case`
lines in your switch would settle it properly.

**Worth a look while you are there:** every other race in that switch is listed individually, so
these four look like omissions rather than intent — but if a City Human is meant to be something
other than Average, say so and the port will follow.

## 38. Four faerie races can only fly in their slight-physique form — is that intended?

**Status:** ANSWERED 2026-09-20 by Daryl · the third reading was right, and the port now follows it

> "In the original version, only female faeries have wings. Males do not have wings. In the
> original rules, Slight Physique was the modifier applied to all females of all races. When he
> did the sheet for Roll20, he changed it so that each player chooses if their character is
> normal, or slight physique, regardless of chosen gender... Do note that for Faeries without
> flight, at least for Dark Faeries, they gain some additional Racial Skills."

So Slight Physique is a CHOICE, not a gender, and the wings follow the choice. The port had the
option all along — the generator has carried the tick since it was built — but never let it reach
the race. Both forms are now shipped on the race document and the tick picks between them.

The wingless form is a TRADE, not a penalty: a wingless Fairy gains Climb and Cover Tracks, a
wingless Dark Fairy gains Climb and Wood Lore +10%. That extra skill is what he first reported as
"Wood Lore +10%, and that is incorrect" — it was correct for the form being shipped, and the wrong
form was being shipped for a winged Dark Fairy.

**One point to confirm when convenient.** He recalled the split being Fairy and Dark Fairy only.
The data has it for **Podling and Sporeling** too (wings in the slight form, none otherwise, no
skill difference), and for **Gremlin** the other way about — it flies either way, and the ORDINARY
form gains Climb. He said he had not checked the others, so the sheet has been followed.

*The original question is kept below, since the reasoning is what made the answer usable.*

**Severity when open:** a Fairy in the port cannot fly, which is almost certainly wrong

`applySingleRaceToAttribs` (sheet-worker.js:33006) answers seven races inline instead of from
`raceStatsAndMoveDetails`. Four of them split on physique, and the split decides whether the race
has wings at all:

```
case "Fairy":
    if (tmpslightphysique=="yes") { tempRaceStatMoves=[ ... ,"Fly:","Run",3,0,"Run",3,0,"Run",3,0, ... ]; }
    else {                         tempRaceStatMoves=[ ... ,"None:","",0,0,"",0,0,"",0,0, ... ]; }
```

The same shape appears for `Fairy(Dark)`, `Podling` and `Sporeling`, and your comments on the
`else` read `// not female` and `// non-female`. Taken literally: only the slight-physique (female)
form of these four has any special movement, and every other member walks.

The port carries no slight-physique option yet, so it takes the ordinary branch, and the result is
a Fairy with no flight — which is why this is being asked rather than quietly followed. Three
readings fit the code and we cannot tell them apart from here:

1. **Intended.** Only females of these races are winged, and a wingless Fairy is correct.
2. **The branches are backwards.** "Slight physique" was meant to be the *exception*, and the
   common case should carry the wings.
3. **Wings are a separate choice.** `fairy_wing_type` and the `Set Wings` / `Alt Wings` handling at
   sheet-worker.js:6394 and 16724 suggest wings may be picked independently of physique, in which
   case neither branch should be hard-coding "None:".

Reading 3 looks most likely, because that wing code exists at all — but it only runs when
`tmpslightphysique=="yes"`, which loops back to the same question.

**What the port does meanwhile:** ships the ordinary branch, says so in each of the four races'
descriptions so nobody is misled, and keeps the slight rows in
`src/packs/named/inlineRaceStats.json` so answering this is a rebuild rather than another dig.

## 39. Two slips in the inline race rows

**Status:** open · **Severity:** one wrong movement rate, one ambiguous pair of flags

Both are in the same switch as item 38, and neither depends on which branch is taken.

1. **Podling's 1-second jog is `-60` where every other race has `-6`.** The movement columns run
   hourly, 10-second, 1-second for each of walk, jog and run. Podling reads:

   ```
   ... ,-3,-30,-3,  -6,-60,-60,  -9,-90,-9, ...
        walk         jog          run
   ```

   Walk and run follow the `-n, -n0, -n` pattern every other race uses; jog's third figure is
   `-60` rather than `-6`. It is in **both** branches, so it is not a branch difference. The port
   carries it as written — a tenfold penalty to a Podling's 1-second jog — rather than silently
   correcting a number only you can confirm.

2. **Sporeling's last two flags are `"no?"` and `"yes?"`.** Every other row in the table ends with
   a plain `"no"`/`"yes"` pair for the formless and can-swim columns; the ordinary branch of
   Sporeling ends `..."no?","yes?"` — with the question marks inside the strings. The slight branch
   above it has the clean pair. The port reads them as the answers you wrote (not formless, can
   swim), since the doubt is clearly about the values and not the format, but a strict reader would
   turn `"yes?"` into false and quietly sink every Sporeling.

## 40. The Fortune check for starting money succeeds on a HIGH roll

**Status:** open · **Severity:** decides whether low Fortune or high Fortune doubles a character's
starting money — the rule is inverted either way round

In `doing_coins` (sheet-worker.js:74161), a non-Noble character gets one roll to multiply their
starting coins:

```
tempfort = parseInt(([tempattrib1+tempattrib2+tempattrib3]/3)+.99)||0;   // AUR, PTY, WIL
if (values.class_modifiers=="+5% Fortune") { tempfort = tempfort+5; }
if (tempfort <= getDieRoll(100) ) {
    madefortune=true;
}
```

`madefortune` is true when the d100 comes up **at or above** the character's Fortune. Every other
percentile check in the sheet succeeds on a roll **at or under** the chance — an attribute save, a
skill check, the Fortune checks elsewhere. As written here, a character with Fortune 10 doubles
their money 91 times in 100 and a character with Fortune 90 manages it 11 times in 100, and the
`+5% Fortune` class modifier makes a character *less* likely to succeed.

Three readings fit, and we cannot choose between them from the code:

1. **A slip**, and it should be `getDieRoll(100) <= tempfort` like every other check.
2. **Deliberate**, on some reading where an unlucky character stumbles into money.
3. **The variable means something else here** — a target number rather than a chance.

**What the port does meanwhile:** reading 1, by the user's ruling of 2026-09-23 — made on a d100
at or under Fortune, as the Player's Guide's "Make a Fortune roll… If the roll is successful" (p.207)
reads too. Starting money is now rolled (`module/starting-money.mjs`), and the comparison is one line
in `checkStartingFortune` with your literal reading written beside it, so if you meant it the other
way round it is a one-line change. Still open with you. Items 67 and 68 are two more things found in
the same function.

*Earlier, until 2026-09-23:* nothing. Starting money was not rolled at all, and this is why the rest
of the rule was transcribed into the notes but not implemented — the multiplier table is
unambiguous and this one line decides who it applies to.

## 41. A Dark Fairy has no Iron Aversion and no Night Vision in `raceFeatureAbilities`

**Status:** open · **Severity:** two racial traits missing from both Fairies

Daryl, 2026-09-20: *"Dark Faery is also missing it's Iron Aversion disability and it's Night Vision
Special Ability/Power in the racial write up."*

He is reading the port, but the port is faithful here — your own table is what is short. The rows
read:

```
"Fairy"       : ["Exceptional Sight,Special Shape",      "Requires Fairy Weapons", ""]
"Fairy(Dark)" : ["Exceptional Sight,Special Dark Shape", "Requires Fairy Weapons", ""]
```

Abilities, disabilities, immunities. Neither Fairy carries Iron Aversion or any Night Vision.

Both traits exist in your sheet and are given to other races. `Iron Aversion` goes to **Brownie,
Changeling, Gremlin and Leprechaun** — four of the faerie folk, which makes the two Fairies
conspicuous by absence. Some form of `Night Vision` goes to **31 races**, including Brownie and
Elf(Dark), but not to either Fairy.

The port has not added them, because the sheet is the source of truth and a racial trait invented
on our side would be indistinguishable from one of yours. Two lines in `raceFeatureAbilities` would
settle it — and it is worth checking whether the same omission reaches the other faerie races,
since these two rows are also the two the sheet answers inline elsewhere and may have drifted from
the rest of the table.

## 42. Ten of the wilderness-gear bands have no `break`, so they take the next band's kit

**Status:** open · **Severity:** a character of social class 5, 12 or 13 gets the wrong band's gear

Each of the six `set...WildernessEquipment` functions is a `switch(tempsocial)`. Five of the six
have bands that do not end in `break`, so they fall into the next band, whose assignments then
overwrite everything they just set. The character ends up with the LATER band's kit entirely.

```
case 5:
    setAttrs({start_armor_clothing:  "Tunic(Leather)" });
    randomnum1=getDieRoll(2);
    if (randomnum1==1) { ...Club,Knife(Stone)...  } else { ...Club,Knife(Obsidian)... }
                                    <-- no break
case 6:
case 7:
    setAttrs({start_armor_clothing:  "Tunic(Leather),Breeches(Leather)" });
    setAttrs({start_weapons:  "Dagger,Quarterstaff" });
    setAttrs({start_general_equipment:  "Waterskin(1-week)" });
    break;
```

A social class 5 character rolls the club-and-knife line, and then has it thrown away: they walk
out with the social 6-7 dagger and quarterstaff. The same shape appears at social 12/13, which
falls into 14 and so carries the 14-and-above gear -- Light Chain and a shield in that kit, rather
than the Armor Suit(Leather) its own band names.

Where it happens:

```
Giant                     social 5 -> 6/7      social 12/13 -> 14..20
Gnome                     social 5 -> 6/7      social 12/13 -> 14/15
GoblinForest              social 5 -> 6/7      social 12/13 -> 14/15
LightChain                social 5 -> 6/7      social 12/13 -> 14..20
NoArmorCompressedSocial   social 5 -> 6
Standard                  (none -- every band breaks)
```

Standard having none is the tell: the same table written correctly once and not the other five
times. The effect is that the social 5 band and the social 12/13 band are dead code in five kits.

**What the port does meanwhile:** follows the code, because the sheet is the source of truth and a
kit invented here would be indistinguishable from one of yours. The extracted table therefore
records social 5 as identical to social 6, and 12/13 as identical to 14 — and says so on every
extraction run, so it cannot quietly become the intended behaviour. Six `break;` statements would
settle it, and the port would pick the change up on the next extraction with nothing else to alter.

## 43. The trap skills are one dictionary row and two list entries, and four names resolve to nothing

**Status:** open · **Severity:** was 106 broken skill grants; the four below are what remain

Daryl reported on 2026-09-21 that Set Trap had not made it into the skill compendium. The bare row
was there all along — what was missing is the pair of variants your own skill list offers.

**Set Trap, Detect Trap and Remove Trap are each ONE row in `skilldict` and TWO entries in
`skilllist`:**

```
skilldict   "Set Trap"                          <- where the numbers live
skilllist   "Set Trap(w)"   "Set Trap(u)"       <- what a player actually picks from
```

Your description says what the letters mean: *"hidden traps, either of a wilderness or urban
nature"*. The bare name appears in `skilllist` not once. Your class skill lists name a variant **73
times** and never the bare form; racial lists name a variant **33 times** and the bare form 4
times. So every class and race granting one was pointing at a name with no row behind it.

The port now builds the six variants from the three rows, inheriting the numbers and adding
"Wilderness traps." or "Urban traps." to the description. Nothing else in your 471-name skill list
is missing from the compendium. **No change is needed on your side for the traps** — this is
recorded so the shape is on paper, because a skill that is one row and two picks is easy to port
wrongly twice.

**Four names still resolve to nothing, and these are yours to answer:**

```
Call of Fire          Elemental Dancer(Fire), slot 32    1 use   -- "Call of Flame" appears 5 times
Divine Knowledge(w)   Druid and Ranger                   3 uses  -- "Divine Knowledge" exists; no (w)
                                                                    variant is in skilllist, unlike the traps
Cover Track           Midfolk(Forest)                    1 use   -- "Cover Tracks" is the skill
Plant Speak           Sporeling                         10 uses  -- this is a SPELL, not a skill
```

The first three look like slips: a single use each against a well-used correct spelling nearby.
`Divine Knowledge(w)` is the interesting one — it carries the trap skills' wilderness suffix, but
unlike them it is not in `skilllist`, so either it is a stray `(w)` or it is a variant you meant to
add and did not.

`Plant Speak` is a different thing: it is in your spell and invocation lists, not your skill
dictionary, and the Sporeling's RACIAL SKILL list names it. A race granting a spell may well be
intended — it simply cannot resolve here yet, because the magic layer is not built. It is listed so
it is not mistaken for a typo later.

**The port reports all four on every extraction run now** rather than letting them pass, which is
the part that was missing: 472 skill references are followed and anything pointing at nothing is
named. That check is what would have caught the traps.

## 44. Beguiler's classType and description are swapped

**Status:** open · **Severity:** one class has no category; the fix is unambiguous but is yours to confirm

Every class in `classRequirementsAndDetails` carries a short category in its classType column —
"Warrior subclass", "Mage subclass", "Rogue/Priest crossover", nine of them across 103 classes.
Beguiler has the two columns **the wrong way round**:

```
classType    "This class has the focus of illusions and uses these skills to dazzle and confuse
              their foes. They have some ability to control as well, starting with animals and
              moving to manipulation and eventually outright control of other beings in ways both
              subtle and overt."
description  "Mage subclass"
```

So the category is not missing — it is sitting in the description, and the description is sitting in
the category. Beguiler is a Mage subclass, and your data says so; it just says it in the wrong
place.

**The port has not swapped them**, on the same footing as the Monk column repair: that one edits
your data and was only made after you confirmed it, and this would be a second such edit. Say the
word and it becomes a one-line entry in `ROW_REPAIRS` beside Monk's, applied on load and printed on
every extraction run. Meanwhile the Items directory files Beguiler under "Other" rather than
creating a folder titled with a paragraph, and the class is otherwise complete and playable.

## 45. Two race names in `racefertiledict` are malformed

**Status:** open · **Severity:** two Half Race pairings are silently impossible; the intent is obvious but the text is yours

Found 2026-09-21 by a new check (`check_race_references` in `build_documents.py`), which follows
every race NAMED by a fertility list or a class's barred-race list and reports any that names no
race that exists. It was written because splitting the faeries into winged and wingless races moved
four names, and nothing would have caught a list left pointing at the old one. It found two faults
of yours on its first run:

```
racefertiledict  Elf(Sea)               ... ,Elf(Wood))          -- one bracket too many
racefertiledict  Human(Civilized:City)  ... ,Human(Barbaric)Human(Civilized:Port), ...
                                                                -- two names, no comma between them
```

Neither is ambiguous: a Sea Elf is meant to be fertile with `Elf(Wood)`, and a City Human with both
`Human(Barbaric)` and `Human(Civilized:Port)`. The effect is small and one-directional — the Half
Race picker offers the first race's partners, so a Sea Elf is not offered a Wood Elf, though a Wood
Elf *is* offered a Sea Elf, because the Wood Elf's own list is spelt correctly. So the pairing is
reachable from one side only.

**The port has not repaired either**, on the same footing as Monk and Beguiler: a repair edits your
data, and the two that exist were both made on your explicit word. Say so and they become two lines
in `ROW_REPAIRS`, applied on load and printed on every run.

**The same check also reports `Famorian` (7 classes) and `Formless` (11 classes) as barred races
that do not exist**, which is not a fault of yours — it is the port's own gap, those two races not
being built yet, and it is tracked on the board rather than here. It is worth recording that your
class data has always expected them.

## 46. `setFormlessStartingRace` has `case "Fairy"` twice, and no case for Sporeling

**Status:** open · **Severity:** a Formless inhabiting a Sporeling gets the previous host's body; the intended row is unambiguous

Found 2026-09-21 while specifying the Formless race. `setFormlessStartingRace`
(`sheet-worker.js:34880`) opens with a guard naming four hosts:

```js
if (tmphost=="Fairy" || tmphost=="Fairy(Dark)" || tmphost=="Sporeling" || tmphost=="Podling") {
```

The switch inside it then has these four cases:

```
line 34891   case "Fairy":
line 34898   case "Fairy(Dark)":
line 34905   case "Podling":
line 34912   case "Fairy":        <-- meant to be "Sporeling"
```

So a Formless whose host is a Sporeling passes the guard, matches no case, and leaves
`tempRaceDetails` holding whatever the last host set — or nothing at all on a fresh sheet. The
fourth case is unreachable, because the first `case "Fairy"` already caught it.

**The intended row is not in doubt.** The numbers in the fourth case are Sporeling's:
`[-4,3,-2,0,0,11,20,18,18,16,"",-2,...]` — a starting Endurance modifier of −2 and limits of
11/20/18 match `Sporeling` in `raceStatsAndMoveDetails` and match no Fairy. The case was evidently
copied from the one above it and the label was not changed.

**Not repaired**, on the same footing as Monk, Beguiler and item 45: it edits your data. It is a
one-word change (`case "Fairy"` to `case "Sporeling"` at line 34912) and nothing else in the
function needs touching. Say the word and it becomes an entry in `ROW_REPAIRS`, applied on load and
printed on every extraction run.

**Not yet reachable in the port either way** — Formless is not built (it takes its whole physical
half from a host race and needs runtime logic, not a row), so this is recorded now, while it is in
front of us, rather than found again later. The spec that will consume this row is
`docs/sonnet/2026-09-21-race-forms.md`.

## 47. Your Formless copy of each race's physical half has drifted from the race table

**Status:** open · **Severity:** low in play, but it is evidence about three other open items

`setFormlessStartingRace` (`sheet-worker.js:34880`) holds its own 36-column dictionary,
`formlessStartingRaceDetails`, giving each host race's physical half: STR/AGL/VIT/APP/SOC and their
limits, starting Endurance, Perception, movement, jump and swimming. Every one of those figures
already exists in `raceStatsAndMoveDetails`. It is a second copy, and the two have drifted apart in
**22 cells across 4 of the 102 races**:

```
Arachen     speedMultiplier / walk hourly / walk 10sec / walk 1sec
            formless copy 1, 10, 1, 0     race row 0, 1, 10, 1
            -- the row reads as though one cell slid, giving an Arachen a 10-mile walking hour

Brachara    special movement
            formless copy "None:"          race row "Swim:" at Walk x3
            -- the Formless copy cannot swim; the race row can

Nixie       special movement
            formless copy "Swim:" Walk x5  race row "Fly:" Run x3
            -- genuinely ambiguous: a Nixie is a water sprite, AND setRacialFeatures gives it
               "Set Wings" unconditionally (16732). Possibly it should have both.

Elf(Ice)    speedMultiplier   formless copy 0   race row -10
Elf(Sea)    speedMultiplier   formless copy 0   race row -10

Gaunt       startEnduranceFormula / startEnduranceMod
            formless copy 0 and 4          race row "" and 0-getDieRoll(4)
```

**The port reads the host's physical half out of the ORDINARY race document** and does not use this
second copy at all, so a Formless in an Arachen moves exactly as an Arachen does. That keeps one
source of truth and means the eight faerie forms and four Maginos materials work as hosts without
this table having to learn about them. Every difference is reported on each extraction run. Say the
word and the Formless copy can win instead for Formless characters.

**Two of these bear on items already open with you:**

- **Item 24 (Elf(Sea) and Elf(Ice) speed multiplier)** — the port reported that a −10 multiplier
  multiplies through into negative movement. **Your Formless copy of both races says 0, not −10**,
  which is the first independent evidence of what was intended. If 0 is right, item 24 is a
  one-cell repair in `raceStatsAndMoveDetails` rather than a rules question.
- **Item 2 (Gaunt's rolled starting Endurance)** — the race row has the live expression
  `0-getDieRoll(4)`, the only non-literal in the whole dictionary. **Your Formless copy writes a
  flat 0 and 4 in those two cells.** That may mean the modifier was meant to be a flat figure, or
  it may be the expression flattened by accident when the copy was made. Either way it is a second
  data point on a question that had none.

## 48. Every resistance roll on your sheet reports "virtually immune"

**Status:** open · **Severity:** high — all five resistance tracks are affected, and they always pass

Found 2026-09-21 while building the resistance roll Daryl reported missing from the port (his
0.11.1 Blocker). Your five handlers — `handleMagicResist` (`sheet-worker.js:1231`),
`handleIllusionResist`, `handleControlResist`, `handlePoisonResist`, `handleDiseaseResist`, all
identical in shape — begin:

```js
resistchance = values.resist_magic;      // getAttrs hands back a STRING
resistchance = resistchance + tempmod;   // so this CONCATENATES, it does not add
halfchance   = parseInt([resistchance+1]/2)||0;
```

`getAttrs` returns strings, so for a character with 50% magic resistance `resistchance` becomes the
string `"50" + 0` = **`"500"`**. A few lines later:

```js
} else if (resistchance>199) {
    ... " has a 200% chance (virtually immune). Thus, they resisted."
```

`"500" > 199` is true, so the roll is never consulted and the answer is always "virtually immune,
they resisted". Checked in a real JavaScript engine against your exact lines:

```
50% resistance, rolled 87  ->  resistchance "500",  halfchance 2500  ->  VIRTUALLY IMMUNE
 5% resistance, rolled 99  ->  resistchance "50",   halfchance  250  ->  did not resist
50% with a +10 modifier    ->  resistchance "5010", halfchance 25050 ->  VIRTUALLY IMMUNE
```

So **any two-digit resistance auto-passes**, and a one-digit one is silently multiplied by ten. A
one-digit resistance happens to give the right answer often enough that it would not stand out in
play. `parseInt` on the attribute would fix all five.

**The port does what you evidently meant** — the figure is a number before the modifier is added —
on the same footing as `lesserAge` and the Monk column repair, and both the rule and this note live
in `module/resistance-rules.mjs` so nothing has to be rediscovered.

**Two smaller things in the same handlers, both kept as you wrote them:**

1. **Your half rounds UP**: `parseInt((chance + 1) / 2)`, so 51% halves to 26, not 25. The attribute
   save in the same file uses a floor. The port keeps both as written rather than making them
   agree — but if they are meant to be the same rule, one of them is wrong.
2. **A natural 1 is not a special case** in any of the five. Daryl's report asks for 1 to be an
   automatic success, which is the convention every other percentile check follows, and the port
   does that. It changes the answer only against a 0% chance, where your code fails a rolled 1.
   **Confirm this one** — it is the only part of the port's resistance roll not read off your sheet.

## 49. A Famorian can never take Regeneration(Budding)

**Status:** open · **Severity:** one evoke of about 120 is unreachable; the fix is one word

Found 2026-09-21 while building the Famorian race. In `setFamorianTempEvokeAbilityList`, the block
that writes Regeneration(Budding) into the evoke list tests the **wrong checkbox**:

```
47429   if (values.famorian_evoke_regen_natural=="on") {
47430       ... tmpevokelist="Regeneration,Natural(limbs regrow at healing rate, ...)"
47431   }
47432   if (values.famorian_evoke_regen_natural=="on") {     <-- should be regen_budding
47433       ... tmpevokelist="Regeneration,Budding(limbs regrow at healing rate, ... Amputated
                              limbs regrow into half-sized beings.)"
47434   }
```

`famorian_evoke_regen_budding` is a real checkbox — it is declared in that function's own `getAttrs`
list, it is reset by `setAttrs({famorian_evoke_regen_budding: "off"})` at 34768, and it counts
towards the evoke budget at 33541. Only this one test is wrong. The effects:

- Ticking **Budding** lists nothing, so the trait a player paid an evoke for never appears.
- Ticking **Natural** lists **both** Natural and Budding, so it reads as two traits for one evoke.

**The port does not reproduce it.** The extractor notices that one checkbox produced two different
labels and hands the second to the next evoke his own `getAttrs` declares — which is
`regen_budding`, the one the block was evidently meant to test — and prints what it did on every
run. So the Famorian compendium entry carries all 120 evokes with Budding among them. Same footing
as `lesserAge` and the Monk repair: the port does what you evidently meant and says so.

This is the third copy-paste slip of the same shape, after item 46 (`case "Fairy"` twice in
`setFormlessStartingRace`, losing a Sporeling host) and item 45 (two run-together race names in
`racefertiledict`). All three are in long hand-written blocks of near-identical lines. No action
needed on the port's side; flagged so your own sheet can be corrected.

## 50. Does a Dark Fairy have Animal Shape?

**Status:** open · **Severity:** one racial skill, and a note that currently qualifies a skill the race is not given

Aspects of the Wild p.4, in the Dark Fairy's entry: "The Animal Shape skill can also allow the Dark
Fairy to assume the form of a DWisp (Darkened Wisp)." The word *also* reads as though the Dark
Fairy has Animal Shape as the Fairy does. Your sheet's `raceSkillDetailValues` gives the plain Fairy
**Animal Shape +20%**, but the Dark Fairy's list has **no Animal Shape at all** -- Darkness +10%,
Blend +20%, Detect Magic, Levitation, Mimic, Move Unheard +10%, Phase, Sing, Telekinesis (and Climb
on the wingless form).

At the user's instruction the port now carries the D'Wisp note on both Dark Fairy forms, but has
**not** added the skill. Should a Dark Fairy have Animal Shape, and at what bonus?

## 51. Is `Mixed` flexibility meant to be Semi-Flexible?

**Status:** open · **Severity:** low — affects which pieces may sit directly against the skin

Found while building the Equip Best Armour button. `armorvalueslist` column 1 gives a piece's
flexibility class, and one of the values it carries is `Mixed` alongside `Clothing`, `Flexible`,
`Semi-Flexible` and the three `Rigid/...` composites. The Player's Guide's layering rules (~p.190)
never mention a `Mixed` class at all — only Flexible, Semi-Flexible, Rigid, and the composites — so
there is nothing in the book to say where it sits in the stiffness order or whether it may be worn
against the body.

The port currently treats `Mixed` as equivalent to `Semi-Flexible` in both respects:
`module/equip-rules.mjs` line 32 gives it the same stiffness number (2), and lines 84-85 let a
`Mixed` piece be the first layer against the skin the same way a `Semi-Flexible` one can, on the
reasoning that the book only requires the first layer to be flexible or padded, and refusing a
`Mixed` piece there (a chain shirt, in the pieces checked) left the character no legal way to wear
it at all. That is a guess at what you meant, not a rule read off your sheet or the books.

Is `Mixed` the same as `Semi-Flexible` for layering purposes, or does it belong somewhere else in
the stiffness order? If it is its own class with its own rule, `getLocationStack` in
`module/equip-rules.mjs` is where the fix goes.

## 52. Does a racial skill's bonus to a Social skill ever actually apply?

**Status:** open · **Severity:** unclear — the table it depends on looks unreachable as written

Found 2026-09-22 chasing Daryl's "racial bonuses to Social skills aren't covered" report. Your
sheet does have such a table: `getRaceClassSocialMod` (sheet-worker.js:57649) gives a small, named
list of Social skills a flat bonus when the character holds a specific racial or class skill —
Acting +15% for Disguise, Animal Training +15% for Speak to Animal or Tame Animal, Begging +15%
for Disguise, Meteorology +10% for Direction Knowledge, Distance Knowledge or Smell,
Perfume/Scent Making +10% for Herb Lore, Tightrope Walking +10% for Balance.

It is called from `getExtraSocialMods` (57589), which is the function `setSocialSkillAbility`
(56962) uses to total a Social skill's modifiers. But the call itself looks wrong:

```
57599   for (var i=0; i<20; i++) {
57600       tmpskillname=""+raceskills[i];
57601       tmpracemod=tmpracemod+parseInt(getRaceClassSocialMod(tmpskill1,raceskills))||0;
57602   }
```

`tmpskillname` is assigned the i'th racial skill and then never used — the call on the next line
passes `raceskills`, the **whole array**, where `getRaceClassSocialMod`'s second parameter is
compared against a single skill name with `==` ("Disguise", "Speak to Animal", and so on). An
array compared to a string with `==` coerces the array to a comma-joined string first, so the
comparison is true only if a character's entire racial skill list, joined by `", "`, is byte-for-
byte one of those six names — which in practice means never, and the loop runs it 20 times over
regardless, once per slot, all with the same (wrong) argument. `tmpskillname` reads like the
argument that was meant to go there.

**The port does not carry this table at all** — checked against `module/skills-rules.mjs`, which
handles Social skill totals, and nothing there applies a racial term. Whether that is a gap worth
closing depends on the answer here: if the call is meant to work, the fix is `getRaceClassSocialMod(tmpskill1, tmpskillname)`,
and the port should add the table (small — six rows) to the Social skill total the way class-skill
bonuses already are. If the array-vs-string comparison is not a bug but some Roll20-specific
coercion you relied on, or if this feature was abandoned deliberately, say so and it stays out.

## 53. "One Eye" in the missile Situation Mods never applies

**Status:** open · **Severity:** low — a -2 that silently never lands

Found 2026-09-22 porting the Situation Mods. `handleMissileSet` (sheet-worker.js:72990) tests
`sit_self_one_eye` and subtracts 2 -- but `sit_self_one_eye` is not in the `getAttrs` list at the
top of the function, so `values.sit_self_one_eye` is always undefined and the test is always false.
Your label beside the box says -2 Missile and your own test says -2, so the port applies -2. If One
Eye was meant to do nothing, say so and it comes out.

## 54. A critically failed Perfect Shot halves damage only when something else multiplies it

**Status:** open · **Severity:** low

The Perfect Shot's Crit Fail puts "Half Dam" in the special modifiers, and the halving is in your
attack's multiplier block (sheet-worker.js:65147, 65155) -- which is inside `if (damMulti!=1.0)`. With
no other multiplier in play, `damMulti` is 1.0 and the halving is never reached, so an ordinary
failed Perfect Shot does full damage. Your label reads "Crit Fail (Half Damage)" without condition,
so the port halves it every time. Say if the condition was intended.

## 55. Three Situation Mods whose label and code disagree, kept as the code has them

**Status:** open · **Severity:** questions rather than defects

1. **"In Cover" is +4 Defense.** On your sheet a positive defence figure is worse for its owner --
   Furious Attack is +4, Desperate Defense -4 -- so being in cover makes the character 4 EASIER to
   hit. Label and code agree on +4, so the port keeps it; it reads as though it should be -4.
2. **Missile "Darkness" says "(-8 Missile/No Defense)"; the missile SET gives no No Defense.** The
   melee SET does. The port follows the code.
3. **Quick Load's Crit Fail ("AGL Save or drop Projectiles") is never read by `handleMissileSet`.**
   The port sets it on a critically failed roll and prints the consequence on the attack card, but
   applies nothing, since there is nothing in your code to apply.

A fourth, smaller one, decided rather than asked: `handlePhysicalAttacks` zeroes the other kind's
situational to-hit, damage and multiplier when a melee attack reads missile modifiers (or the other
way round), but the line that would clear the special words is commented out, so a missile panel's
"Max" or "+1 per Die" would reach a sword blow. The port clears them too. See `docs/DECISIONS.md`,
"Situation Mods".

## 56. Martial arts: where your code and your own martial prose disagree

**Status:** open · **Severity:** mixed -- several make a move or stance do something other than its
own description, two stop a whole feature working

Found 2026-09-22 porting Martial Knowledge and Martial Lore (`module/combat/martial-arts.mjs`). Your
code is followed wherever it is consistent with itself. Where your CODE and your OWN dictionary prose
for the same thing disagree, and the Player's Guide sides with the prose, the port takes the prose
as what you meant; each such place is listed so you can say otherwise, and each is one line to put
back (`MARTIAL_MOVE_CORRECTIONS`, `MARTIAL_STANCE_CORRECTIONS`, `MARTIAL_SKILLMOD_CORRECTIONS`).

**Where the port follows your prose over your code**

1. **Flying adds +1 damage in `handleMartialModifierSet`** (`MKModDamage+1`, sheet-worker.js:68179).
   Your move text says "To hit +4, Dam x2"; the book "doubles damage rolled". It reads as Jump's line
   copied. The port gives +4 and x2 only.
2. **Spinning is +4 to hit in your code** (68198), "+2" in your move text and "by 2" in the book.
   The port gives +2. **Ruled by the user 2026-09-22: +2, the book's figure** -- so this one is
   decided on our side; tell us only if the +4 was a deliberate change you want kept.
3. **Double Attack says "-1 Sec Martial Attack"** (68219); your move table's speed is "+1", its text
   "Adds 1 second to each attack", and the book agrees. The port adds a second.
4. **Drunken fighting writes "+1 Die Dam" / "+2 Die Dam"** (68986, 68998) -- an extra die. Your stance
   text says "+1 per die of damage" (+2 mastered), and Mysteries of the Planes p.167 agrees. The port
   adds per die.
5. **Flow as water's "+1 second to offensive actions" is never applied**: every reader of the stance
   text (`handleGrappleMoveChange`, `setAdjustmentsForLoreWeaponSpeed`, line 82793) looks only for
   "-1 second" and "-2 seconds". The port applies +1.
6. **Immoveable Stance's modifier is +5** in `martialmovevalueslist`, but its rating is 17, which by
   your subskill rule is -5 against Martial Knowledge's 16 -- and the book prints "Rating 17 / -5%".
   The port uses -5. (Jump is also off the rule, 14 giving +10 where the table says +20, but the book
   prints +20 too, so Jump is left as you have it.)
7. **Martial Lore values are rolled against Martial KNOWLEDGE** (`handleMLSkillRoll`, 68651, calls
   `storeTempSkillChanceAndMessage("Martial Knowledge")`), but all twelve modifiers are worked from
   Martial Lore's rating of 18. The handler looks copied from the move roll above it. The port rolls
   them against Martial Lore.

**Slips that stop something working, where the intent is plain**

8. **A made move never registers.** `handleMoveSkillRoll` writes `martialN_move_success: "fix"` on
   success (68082); `handleMartialModifierSet` only counts `"on"`. So SET after a successful Jump
   adds nothing unless the box is ticked by hand. The port puts a made move in play directly.
9. **The fifth Martial Lore value reads the fifth MOVE's success** (`successList` in
   `handleMartialLoreModifierSet`, 68280: `values.martial5_move_success`).
10. **100% Martial Lore never keeps a blind character's defence.** `setMartialLoreDisplayValues`
    writes "Full Defensive Mod"; `setBodyHeaderValues` (102808) tests for "Full Defense Mod". Your
    `handleMeleeSet` uses the right spelling. The port keeps the defence, per the book.
11. **Spinning's "+2 per Die" never reaches a martial attack**: `getMartialDamageDetails` tests
    "+2 Per Die" (capital P). Your weapon path uses lower case and does apply it. The port applies it
    to both.
12. **Martial attack slot 2 never gets its martial damage bonus**: its button passes
    `values.martial_arts_mod_damag` (20348), which is always undefined.
13. **Custom discipline: one box adds all three Torso holds.** `setMartialKnowArts` tests
    `martial_hold5_check` for Torso, Torso(1 Arm) and Torso(2 Arms), and never reads hold6 or hold7,
    though your sheet has a box for each. The port takes each hold on its own.
14. **"Already known?" matches by substring**: `tempMKHoldsList.includes("Arm")` is true for someone
    who knows only Torso(1 Arm), so they can never learn the Arm hold with Martial Lore. The port
    matches whole names.

**Things your sheet prints but never applies, which the port does, because the book says to**

15. Jump's "+1 Die Dam" reaches martial attacks only; the book: "This can be applied to weapon
    attacks as well as martial attacks." Tension's doubling reaches weapons only; the book: "a
    stronger weapon or martial attack". Snap's "-1 Sec, No STR Mod" is never read at all.
16. **Tension in two hands**: your weapon path tests two hands first and never reaches Tension, so a
    two-handed Tension attack doubles Strength. The book's note: "tripled (not quadrupled) when using
    the weapon with two hands during a Tension Attack". The port trebles.

**Where the book says more than your sheet, and your sheet is followed**

- Martial Lore's blind fighting: the book gives +2 to hit, +1 damage and +5% skills per 25%; your
  sheet gives +1 to hit per 25% and nothing else. **Ruled by the user 2026-09-22: the book's.** So
  it is +2 to hit per level for melee AND missile (your SET reads it for melee only), never past the
  blindness penalty it offsets, with +1 damage and +5% to combat skills while blind. And a "Full
  Defensive Mod" now keeps only a defence lost to blindness -- your handleMeleeSet clears the No
  Defense override whatever set it, so a blind fighter who critically failed a Critical kept theirs.
- The book says Flying "replaces" Jump; your sheet lets both apply at once.
- The book says no offensive manoeuvre is possible in Immoveable Stance; your sheet only takes the
  defence away.
- A martial fumble goes straight to the critical fumble table on a failed Agility save, with no
  80/20 split first -- yours, and kept.

**Questions your sheet leaves open (not guessed at)**

- A Martial Lore value has no speed column. The book gives some (Flip 2 seconds, Feather Block +1,
  Slam +2) and not others. **Ruled by the user 2026-09-22: the book's.** Flip takes 2 seconds, a
  made Feather Block adds 1 to the block and a made Slam 2 to the throw; the rest happen with the
  attack, hold or throw they go with (Combined Attack takes the longer of its two attacks).
- Stances carry skill and save bonuses in their text ("Dodge, Feint and Sidestep +30%", "+20% to all
  AGL Saves", resistances). Your sheet prints them and applies none. **Ruled by the user 2026-09-22:
  they apply automatically while the stance is held**, with a control for each that depends on
  something the sheet cannot see -- how many VIT saves for intoxication have been failed (the
  Drunken stance works from 1 to 3, 5 mastered, and outside that adds NOTHING, its to-hit and damage
  included, which your sheet applies regardless), and whether a hold or movement effect is being
  resisted (Calm in the storm's +25%/+50% to every resistance).
- The missing-limb checks (`racial_standard_disabilities` "All manipulator limbs lost" and the rest)
  are not ported, because the port does not track lost limbs yet. One of them tests a hold named
  "Leg Block" (67446), which is a block; "Leg" is presumably meant.

## 57. Starting lore: Poison Lore held twice gives one recipe, not two

**Status:** open · **Severity:** low -- a character is short one poison recipe and its stock

Found 2026-09-22 porting "Provide random lore" (`provideRandomLoreAndLoreItems`, sheet-worker.js:146686).
Every step of that chain builds its list with `if (first) { list = x; first = false; } else { list += "," + x; }`.
`checkPoisonRecipeLore` (146965) has the same shape but never sets `first` to false, so each pass
of its loop OVERWRITES the list, and a character holding Poison Lore twice (racial and class, say)
ends with the last recipe drawn and its doses, and nothing for the first. Its own comment says
"provide lore for each skill instance", and every sibling step does, so the port gives one recipe
(and one stock) per instance. If only one was meant, say so and it is one line in `rollStartingLore`
(`module/lore-rules.mjs`, @MARKER POISON STEP).

## 58. Two names your starting-lore lists draw that your dictionaries do not hold

**Status:** open · **Severity:** low -- a blank row, or nothing, where a herb or a hymn should be

Found 2026-09-22 by checking every name in the fourteen `get<Lore>List` functions against the
dictionary it is looked up in. Two miss:

- **`Zebra Gras`** in `getHerbLoreList` (147313). `herblist` has **Zebra Grass** (128747) and so does
  the herb dropdown. A new herbalist who draws it gets `getHerbDetails("Zebra Gras")`, which finds
  nothing.
- **`Injury`** in `getUnalignedHymnList` (146920). It is in the hymn dropdown (sheet HTML) and has a
  case in `doHymnAction` (139894), but `hymnlorelist` has no row for it, so there is no rating,
  modifier or description to add.

The port reports both when drawn and adds nothing rather than an empty item
(`tools/extract/extract_lore_tables.py` prints them on every run). Is Zebra Gras just the typo it
looks like, and what are Injury's rating, modifier, start time, duration and description?

## 59. Two slips in the potion code

**Status:** open · **Severity:** cosmetic

- **`potionlist` row `"Enhancing(Sight/Taste)"` (133073) has `"Enhancing(Sight/Smell)"` in its name
  column.** Its description is the Sight/Taste one, so the row is right and the name is not. The row
  added to a sheet displays Sight/Smell, the same name as the row above it. The port names it by its
  key, Sight/Taste.
- **`usePotionRecipe` (142826) rolls with the `poison-recipeuse` template**, so brewing a potion
  shows a Poison Lore card title. `usePotionRecipeMod` uses the potion one.

## 60. Starting lore counts class skills the character has not reached

**Status:** open · **Severity:** a question -- the port follows your code

`storeSkillCountForSkills` (98140) counts a lore skill across the racial rows AND the class rows for
titles 1 to 10 -- and at creation `setFinalClassSkills` has written a class's whole progression onto
those rows, reached or not (63177). So a new character gets starting entries for lores its class
will not give until later: a new White Witch starts with a potion recipe though Potion Lore is her
title-8 skill, and with a poison recipe from title 6. Your own comment on the function says "doesn't
look at class skills over 10th title", which reads as deliberate -- a class's lore arriving with its
first practitioner, entries and all. The port does the same. If it should count only the skills the
character has reached (title 1 at creation), it is one filter in `getCountedSkillNames`
(`module/lore-rules.mjs`).

Two smaller things the port does differently, neither of which changes what can be drawn:

- Your "already drawn?" tests are substring tests on the joined list, so "Healing" is refused after
  "Super Healing", and the starting spell "Hold" after "Hold Plant" or "Hold Animal". The port
  compares whole names.
- A list shorter than the number of times the skill is held would loop for ever in your `while`
  (none of your lists is that short, so it cannot happen with your data). The port stops when the
  list runs out.

## 61. The round clock: two readings the port had to make

**Status:** open · **Severity:** questions -- neither changes a normal round

The port now tracks each combatant's seconds through the round as your Mr. Initiative chart does
(Master's Manual pp.98-100): the seconds lost to a late start, spent and left, the split second,
the extra seconds, the off hand and carry-over. Two places needed a reading.

1. **A carried action's reaction roll of 0 or less.** Carry-Over (Player's Guide p.168): "A new
   initiative is rolled at the point when the character finishes the action, and is added to his
   last second... He rolls a 3, and adds this to the 2 seconds carry-over time, and thus must wait
   until the 5th second... Negative initiative rolls do not subtract." Read literally, a 0 adds
   nothing and the next action starts in the same second the carried one finished in. The port
   treats a 1 as "the very next second", which is what a 1 means at the start of a round, and reads
   "do not subtract" as nothing lower than that: a 0 or a negative also means the next second. Is
   that right, or should a 0 really share the finishing second?

2. **Which half of a split second is the extra one.** Your chart splits each of the first seconds
   into "a" and "b" and adds the extra time "in the second half of each second, represented with a
   b". Your sheet says "speed seconds occur before the normal second", and has a sped character's
   initiative set to -10 less the speed seconds so they sort first. The port follows the sheet: the
   extra half is "a", and a sped combatant acts before everyone else in that second. It only decides
   who goes first within one second. Also following the sheet, anyone with speed seconds from an
   effect starts at the first second whatever they rolled ("always wins initiative", as the Speed
   potion puts it).

## 62. Seven poison types last hours when used, minutes on their row

**Status:** open · **Severity:** real, when a poison is used -- a poison meant to last minutes lasts hours

`doPoisonAction` (sheet-worker.js:135358) writes the duration of types IV, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII and
XX as "Effects last 1d6=N hour(s)" (IV "1d10 ... hour(s)"). Your own `getPoisonDetails` (135117), the
text the poison carries on its row, says **minutes** for all seven, and so does the Master's Manual's
poison table. A type IX at 1d6 hours of 1d6 Endurance a minute is sixty times the poison it reads as.
The hours may have come across from III, V and VI, which are hours on every source (135455-135467).

The port follows the row and the book: minutes. Are they minutes?

## 63. A rune's damage: the weapon's own dice, or d6?

**Status:** open · **Severity:** a question -- changes every runed weapon's damage

Your rune dictionary, and the tag your Customize panel writes, give a weapon rune as "+Nd6+N"
damage for a rune of level N. Your attack code does something else: it adds N to the **weapon's**
dice count (64973 -- a 1d8 sword with a rune of 2 rolls 3d8) and adds the flat +N only inside the
verbose damage listing (65040), so the card shows "Rune (+2)" but the total never includes it.

The port follows the dictionary and the tag: +Nd6+N, flat bonus included, since that is what a
player reading the rune is told it does. Which did you mean -- and is the flat +N meant to be rolled?

## 64. A Doubling Blade changes nothing on the combat sheet

**Status:** open · **Severity:** low -- one customization has no effect

Your Customize panel offers "Doubling Blade(Axe)", value `Doubling Blade`, and `customizeItem` writes
`[Doubling Blade]` into the name. Your listing functions test for `[Double Blade]` beside
`[Double Head]` -- strength x1.2 (89861), a second slower (89911), +20% to skills (90025) -- so a
Doubling Blade never gets them. The port reads Doubling Blade as Double Blade. Is that what you meant?

## 65. Customizing a whole stack can stop on an undeclared name

**Status:** open · **Severity:** real, but narrow -- the customize does nothing

In `customizeItem`, the two branches for customizing every item of a stack of more than one
(`currentitems==tmpitemnumber`, 79102 and 79106) build the new name with
`...+tmpbasepietytmpnewweaprune+...` -- a missing `+` between `tmpbasepiety` and `tmpnewweaprune`.
Reading an undeclared name throws, so when that stack is the first weapon in the list the whole
customize stops there. The `else` half of the same lines has the `+`. The port does not share the
code; noted for your sheet.

## 66. A positive Gravity rune makes a weapon lighter

**Status:** open · **Severity:** moderate — the rune does the opposite of what it says below +100%

Your rune tag writes a Gravity rune of level N as "+N×10% weight" (sheet-worker.js:14630), and your
rune dictionary says "its weight is increased or decreased". But `getGravityRuneWeightMod` (90404)
runs "+30%" through `convertPercentNumToMulti` (26140), which reads a positive figure as a percentage
OF the weight -- so +30% makes a weapon 0.3 of its weight. Only from +100% up does it get heavier.
Negative levels come out right (-50% is half). The port takes the rune's words: +30% is x1.3. If the
"200 = double" reading was meant for runes too, say so and it comes back.

## 67. Nobles' starting money is never multiplied by 5 or 10

**Status:** open · **Severity:** a noble character starts with a fifth or a tenth of the book's money

In `setCoins` (sheet-worker.js:74272 onward), social classes 15 to 20 roll their dice and then:

```
tempcoins=getDiceRollNoMod(8, 4);
tempcoins*5;
setAttrs({start_gold: tempcoins });
```

`tempcoins*5;` works out the product and throws it away, because nothing assigns it. It needs to be
`tempcoins=tempcoins*5;`. The same slip is in all six Noble cases (`*5` at 15, `*10` at 16–20). As
the sheet runs, a King's family starts with 10–200 pp. The Player's Guide's Starting Money table
(p.207) gives "(10d20)x10", 100–2000 pp, and has "(8d4)x5" and "(5d10)x10" and so on for the rest.

**What the port does:** multiplies, by the user's ruling of 2026-09-23. The multiplication is written
in your code and the book agrees, so it reads as meant and simply not assigned.

## 68. The starting-money Fortune roll uses a Fortune without its race or class bonus

**Status:** open · **Severity:** small — a few points either way on the Fortune roll for starting money

`setCoins` (sheet-worker.js:74148) works out a Fortune of its own rather than reading the
character's:

```
getAttrs(['aur_final','pty_final','wil_final','soc_final','race_tmp_for_mod','tmp_class_modifiers'], ...
tempraceformod = parseInt(values.race_tmp_for_mod)||0;
tempclassformod = ""+values.tmp_class_modifiers;
tempfort = parseInt(([tempattrib1+tempattrib2+tempattrib3]/3)+.99)||0;
if (values.class_modifiers=="+5% Fortune") { tempfort = tempfort+5; }
```

Two things fall out:

1. **The race's Fortune modifier is fetched and never added.** `tempraceformod` is set and not used,
   so a Dwarf(Fire)'s +5 or an Avian(Forest)'s −10 makes no difference to the roll.
2. **The class's "+5% Fortune" can never apply.** The test reads `values.class_modifiers`, but the
   field fetched is `tmp_class_modifiers`, so `values.class_modifiers` is always undefined.
   `tempclassformod` holds the right value and is not used either.

Your real Fortune calculation (`changeCharacteristics`, 30333) adds both, plus the first title's +1
(`class_title_fortune`, 8158). **What the port does:** rolls against that whole Fortune, by the
user's ruling of 2026-09-23 — the Fortune the character actually has.

Also worth knowing: on your sheet the money is rolled when the racial features are confirmed (step
3, 6439), before the class is chosen at step 5, so the class bonus could not be known then even if
the field name were right. The port rolls on its Details step, after the class, for that reason.
