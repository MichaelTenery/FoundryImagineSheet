build_documents.py -- turn the named extraction into Foundry document JSON.

Build-time tooling. Not shipped with the Foundry system.

Reads src/packs/named/ and writes src/packs/documents/, shaping each entry to match the
schemas in module/data/. This is the step where the source's string-typed data meets the
typed schema, so it is also where any mismatch between the two shows up.

The source stores everything as strings, including numbers, and uses several sentinels:
    "Non"   a weapon attack mode that does not exist for this weapon
    "-"     a range band that does not apply
    ""      absent
    "+5%"   a percentage modifier
    "`"     stands in for an apostrophe, as in "Player`s Guide"

Anything that will not convert is reported rather than silently coerced -- a skill rating
that quietly becomes 0 is worse than one that fails loudly.

Usage:
    python build_documents.py --check
    python build_documents.py --write

# ordinary WEAPON, the user's call on 2026-09-23: "I very much do want them in the weapons section
# up with all the other equipment... If the player doesn't want them, they can remove them." A
# weapon already carries everything his attack row does -- damage, speed, minimum speed, a mode --
# and his handleNaturalAttack (sheet-worker.js:69996) rolls one the way a weapon is rolled: the
# d20 down the attack chart, Strength to hit, the damage modifiers on top.
#
# Named "<race> <attack>" -- "Saurian Claws" -- because a Saurian's claws and a Katara's are not
# the same weapon, the importer matches by name, and a bracketed name would be read back for his
# quality tags ([Good], [Float]) by the code that reads names.
#
# HIS TYPE -> THE WEAPON'S MODE. His type is a label on the card; the port's weapon picks its
# damage type from its mode, so the nearest mode is used and anything that is not exact is said so
# in the weapon's own description:
#
#     his type      mode             exact?

# @MARKER SLIGHT PHYSIQUE
# This is the function which builds a race's second form, where it has one.
#
# Slight Physique is a CHOICE in his Roll20 sheet, not a consequence of gender -- he cut it loose
# from the original rules' "every female" when he built the sheet, and confirmed that on
# 2026-09-20. For most races it is only -1 Strength and +1 Agility, which lands on the ratings and
# leaves the race itself untouched, so `hasVariant` stays false and nothing else here matters.
#
# GREMLIN is the one race left that reaches this with real data: it has a genuine slight-physique
# variant, and unlike the four winged faeries below it flies either way, so there is no lock and no
# split race document -- the difference is only its ordinary form gaining the racial skill Climb.
#
# Fairy, Fairy(Dark), Podling and Sporeling used to be built here too -- their slight form had
# WINGS and their ordinary one none, tied to extra racial skills on the wingless Fairies -- but
# Michael's 2026-09-21 ruling (see @MARKER RACE FORMS, below) turned each into two race DOCUMENTS
# instead, one per wing state, each with `physiqueLock` set so the choice can never be made twice.
# Their entries in `inlineRaceStats`/`inlineRaceSkills` are still read, just not through here --
# `build_slight_physique` is called with a blank name for a locked form (see its call site) so it
# never looks their data up. This function's schema stays: a homebrew race may still declare a real

# @MARKER RACE FORMS
# Five races are ONE entry in his dictionaries and MORE THAN ONE race a character can actually be.
# His sheet handles that with a SECOND dropdown beside the race picker -- maginos_material, and the
# slight-physique tick -- and writes the answer into the name as "Maginos[Clay]". A Foundry race is
# an Item, and there is no second dropdown to hang off it, so each form becomes a race document of
# its own. That is the call already made for the classes that split on a good/evil choice
# (Knight(Templar) and Knight(Dark Templar)), and these are named the same way.
#
# THE FOUR WINGED FAERIES. In his code the slight-physique branch of Fairy, Fairy(Dark), Podling and
# Sporeling is the one that sets "Fly:", and the ordinary branch sets "None:" -- so among these four,
# slight build IS what wings mean, and the two were never independent choices. Michael's call,
# 2026-09-21: tie them together. A winged form is locked to slight physique and a wingless one is
# locked out of it, which `physiqueLock` carries through to the generator.
#
# Gremlin is deliberately NOT here. It has a slight-physique variant too, and it flies EITHER way --
# the difference is a racial skill going the other way, its ordinary form gaining Climb -- so there
# is no winged/wingless split to make and its tick stays the free choice it has always been.
#
# THE FOUR MAGINOS MATERIALS are four full rows of his own, differing only in endurance and in
# whether the thing floats. His bare "Maginos" row is identical to his Clay one and is kept as the
# [Other] material his sheet offers for a Maginos built of something he does not list, so that race
# is added to rather than replaced. Its materials are read from the data rather than named here.

# This is the function which builds the Formless race, which is not a row and never was.
#
# A Formless is a free-floating psyche with no body of its own. It supplies its MENTAL half and
# takes its PHYSICAL half from a host race it inhabits, and his code splits it exactly that way:
# applySingleRaceToAttribs case "Formless" (33625) sets INT/WIS/KNW/CHM/AUR/PTY/WIL and nothing
# physical, and setFormlessStartingRace (34880) supplies STR/AGL/VIT/APP/SOC, starting Endurance,
# Perception, movement, jump and swimming out of the host. Between them all twelve attributes are
# covered once each and nothing twice.
#
# So the document built here is HALF A RACE on purpose. Its physical modifiers are 0 and its
# physical limits sit at the schema default, because a Formless without a host has no body to put
# a number on -- which is his own answer too: applyRaceToAttribs refuses a Formless with no host
# ("No Formless host race name found/selected. Nothing done.", 4539). combineFormless in
# module/race-rules.mjs is what puts the two halves together, and the character flags a Formless
# with no host rather than refusing it, as it flags every other race problem.
#
# The host's physical half is read from the HOST'S OWN race document rather than from his second

# @MARKER HAND-AUTHORED CONTENT
# Every pack can take hand-authored entries, from src/packs/manual/<pack>.json, merged over what his
# sheet-worker builds. This is the way content is added to the system without touching code: a new
# class, a homebrew weapon, a race from a book he has not yet put in his sheet, or a correction to
# one of his entries. See docs/ADDING-CONTENT.md.
#
# The file shape, the same for every pack:
#
#     {
#       "_about": "anything -- keys starting with _ are notes and are never read as content",
#       "entries": {
#         "Name Of Thing": { ...the item's system fields, exactly as a document of that pack has them... },
#         "Another":       { "_override": true, ...only the fields to change on his entry of that name... }
#       }
#     }
#
# The rules:
#   - A NEW name is added as a new document. Fields left out take the schema's defaults when it is
#     imported into Foundry, so an entry only has to say what matters.
#   - A name his data ALREADY builds is ignored and reported, unless the entry says "_override": true.
#     Then its fields are laid over his, field by field (a list replaces a list whole), and that too is
#     reported, every run. His data is the source of truth, so changing it has to be said out loud.
#   - A class name that is the BASE of his paths (Elemental Dancer, of Elemental Dancer(Water) and the
#     rest) counts as built.
#   - With no sourcebook given, a hand-authored entry is tagged "Custom". That puts every piece of
#     homebrew under one switch in the Game Master's content settings, so it can all be turned off
#     together, or kept out of a campaign that wants the published game only.
#   - A field name the pack's documents do not have is reported, since it is almost always a typo
#     that would otherwise be silently dropped on import.

# His Magic/Lore tab's content, as four packs: consumables (herbs, potions, elixirs, charms),
# lore (the twelve lores and the evokes), spells and invocations. Poisons are not here -- a poison
# is built from a type and a potency by getPoisonDetails, not listed, so the sheet makes one when
# it is wanted (module/lore-rules.mjs).
#
# Each document carries its kind, as his repeating-section name, and the magic subsystem that kind
# answers to. The subsystems are those of MAGIC_KINDS in module/lore-rules.mjs, which is the one
# place they are decided; this table only repeats them so the build does not have to run JavaScript.

KIND_KEYED_PACKS = {"consumables", "lore"}

# The packs his Master Index has not been matched against AT ALL yet -- apply_sources() is not
# even called for these, so every one of their documents stays "XXX". A name alone is not enough
# for any of the four Magic & Lore packs (his rune Balance would take the page of the Balance
# skill, and his spell Chill and invocation Chill are different entries on different pages), which
# is why apply_sources() now takes a kind and looks up "kind|Name" for them -- see @MARKER SOURCE
# ATTRIBUTION and docs/sonnet/2026-09-22-magic-lore-tab.md item 6.
#
# spells and invocations came out of this set on 2026-09-23: his Master Index prints a Spell/
# Level/Source table (sixteen of them, by spell type, plus three "roll a die" tables) and an
# Invocation/Level/Alignment/Source table (thirteen Devotion chapters), one row per spell or
# invocation, kind-tagged by extract_sources.py's read_kind_tables(). Every spell and invocation
# name is looked up against its own table now, kind-safe, so calling apply_sources() on these two
# is no longer a way to attribute something wrongly -- only to leave it XXX when his index truly
# does not carry it.
#
# lore came out of this set on 2026-09-23 too: attribution is decided per KIND, not per pack, and
# a pack does not have to wait for its LAST kind before its FIRST one is put to use. Four of lore's
# eleven kinds (ballad, rune, poem, song) have the same kind of table as spells and invocations and
# are kind-keyed in itemSources.json; apply_sources(docs, "*") reads each lore document's own
# "kind" field and looks up "kind|Name" for it, same as spells and invocations do for their one
# fixed kind. The other seven lore kinds (candlelore, empathymagic, glyph, hymn, ritual,
# sympathymagic, evoke) print as prose, not one-row-per-line tables ("All Candle Lore Rituals",
# "Charms (All)", etc.), so itemSources.json has no "kind|Name" rows for them at all -- a document
# of one of those kinds simply finds no match and is marked XXX by apply_sources() itself, the same
# way any other unmatched document is, not by being excluded here.
#
# consumables stays in this set: none of its four kinds (herb, potion, elixir, charm) has a table
# to read at all -- no Herb, Elixir or Charm table anywhere in the index, and the one "Potion
# Costs" table carries no Source column -- so there is nothing yet for apply_sources() to find
# there, and it is left exactly as it was: XXX throughout.
