build_system.py -- assemble the installable Foundry system into dist/imagine-rpg/.

Build-time tooling. Not shipped with the system (it builds the thing that is).

WHAT SHIPS AND WHAT DOES NOT. A Foundry system is a folder under Data/systems/ named after the
system's id. It needs the manifest, the code, the templates, the stylesheet, the language files and
-- for this system -- the generated content documents, which the importer fetches at runtime rather
than being compiled into packs ahead of time.

Everything else in this repository is how the system was BUILT, not part of it: the extraction
tooling, the raw and named intermediate data, the browser test suites and previews, the original
Roll20 export, and the project's own documentation. None of that belongs in a game's Data folder.

    shipped                             not shipped
    system.json                         tools/
    module/**.mjs                       src/packs/raw/, named/, manual/
    templates/**.hbs                    ImagineRoll20CharacterSheet-main/
    styles/*.css                        docs/ (except FIRST-RUN.md, which is for whoever installs it)
    lang/*.json                         CLAUDE.md, .claude/, .git/
    src/packs/documents/*.json

THE CHECK IS THE POINT. Copying files is easy to get right by accident and wrong by accident. So
after assembling, this reads every `systems/imagine-rpg/...` path the shipped code and templates
mention, plus every file the manifest names, and proves each one is present in the output. A
template referenced but not copied would otherwise show up as an empty sheet in someone's game.

INSTALL_NOTE = """# Imagine Role Playing System — Foundry VTT system

Version {version}. A conversion of the Imagine Role Playing System from its Roll20 character sheet,
built with permission from the rights holder. Foundry VTT **V14** or later.

## Installing

This folder IS the system. Put it in your Foundry data folder, under `Data/systems/`, so that the
path reads:

    Data/systems/imagine-rpg/system.json

Then restart Foundry. The system appears in the Game Systems list and can be chosen when creating a
world. (If you have the zip, unpack it so its contents land directly in a folder of that name —
the archive has no top-level folder of its own.)

## Updating

**Version {version} and later update themselves.** In Foundry's **Game Systems** tab, press
**Check for Updates**; if a newer version has been published, an **Update** button appears and
Foundry fetches and installs it. Nothing needs to be copied by hand.

This works because the manifest names where to look:

    manifest   the current system.json in the project repository
    download   the archive beside it

Foundry compares the version in your installed `system.json` against the version in the manifest,
and offers the update when they differ. It compares the version number and **nothing else** — not
dates, not file contents — so a build published without raising the version is invisible to every
existing install.

One catch, once: an install from BEFORE {version} has no `download` in its manifest and cannot
update itself. Replace that folder by hand one last time, and every update after it is a button.

After updating, rebuild the compendium content so new and corrected entries come through — the
packs are built in your world, not shipped:

    game.imagine.importContent()

## First launch

The system ships its content as JSON and builds the compendium packs when you first use it, rather
than shipping pre-built packs. On the first launch of a new world it offers to do that; accept, and
it creates nine compendia holding 4,384 entries — skills, weapons, armour, equipment, races,
classes, and the ability, disability and immunity lists.

If you decline, or want to rebuild them later after updating the system, run this in the console as
the Game Master:

    game.imagine.importContent()

It matches documents by name and updates them in place, so anything already dragged onto a character
keeps pointing at the same document.

## Before you trust it

**This system has never been run in Foundry.** `FIRST-RUN.md`, beside this file, lists what was
checked against the V14 API ahead of time, what could not be, and a ten-step smoke test in the order
things are likely to break. Step 5 is the one that matters most.

## What is not here

Everything that built this: the extraction tooling, the intermediate data, the test suites, the
original Roll20 export and the project documentation. Those live in the project repository; this
folder is only what a game needs.
